| **[Training Together, Diagnosing Better: Federated Learning for Collagen VI-Related Dystrophies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16876v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Upper Bound on the M/M/k Queue With Deterministic Setup Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16854v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These "setup times" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues. Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bit of a Close Talker: A Practical Guide to Serverless Cloud Co-Location Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10361v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud computing by offering users an efficient, cost-effective way to develop and deploy applications without managing infrastructure details. However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and to devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks via normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy, the Double-Dip scheduler, to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |
| **[Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16813v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delay-Aware Multi-Stage Edge Server Upgrade with Budget Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16792v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the Multi-stage Edge Server Upgrade (M-ESU) is proposed as a new network planning problem, involving the upgrading of an existing multi-access edge computing (MEC) system through multiple stages (e.g., over several years). More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Efficient Bitcoin Meta-Protocol Transaction and Data Discovery Through nLockTime Field Repurposing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16683v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe the Lockchain Protocol, a lightweight Bitcoin meta-protocol that enables highly efficient transaction discovery at zero marginal block space cost, and data verification without introducing any new on-chain storage mechanism. The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even-Cycle Detection in the Randomized and Quantum CONGEST Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12018v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the \CONGEST{} model by a randomized Monte-Carlo distributed algorithm with one-sided error probability $1/3$. This matches the best round-complexities of previously known algorithms for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$ by Drucker et al. [PODC'14] and Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'20], but improves the complexities of the known algorithms for $k>5$ by Eden et al. [DISC'19], which were essentially of the form $\tilde O(n^{1-2/k^2})$. Our algorithm uses colored BFS-explorations with threshold, but with an original \emph{global} approach that enables to overcome a recent impossibility result by Fraigniaud et al. [SIROCCO'23] about using colored BFS-exploration with \emph{local} threshold for detecting cycles. We also show how to quantize our algorithm for achieving a round-complexity $\tilde O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ in the quantum setting for deciding $C_{2k}$ freeness. Furthermore, this allows us to improve the known quantum complexities of the simpler problem of detecting cycles of length \emph{at most}~$2k$ by van Apeldoorn and de Vos [PODC'22]. Our quantization is in two steps. First, the congestion of our randomized algorithm is reduced, to the cost of reducing its success probability too. Second, the success probability is boosted using a new quantum framework derived from sequential algorithms, namely Monte-Carlo quantum amplification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cornserve: Efficiently Serving Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14098v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Cornserve, an efficient online serving system for an emerging class of multimodal models called Any-to-Any models. Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving. Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source at https://github.com/cornserve-ai/cornserve</p></details> |
| **[XTC, A Research Platform for Optimizing AI Workload Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16512v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving high efficiency on AI operators demands precise control over computation and data movement. However, existing scheduling languages are locked into specific compiler ecosystems, preventing fair comparison, reuse, and evaluation across frameworks. No unified interface currently decouples scheduling specification from code generation and measurement. We introduce XTC, a platform that unifies scheduling and performance evaluation across compilers. With its common API and reproducible measurement framework, XTC enables portable experimentation and accelerates research on optimization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient CPU-GPU Collaborative Inference for MoE-based LLMs on Memory-Limited Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16473v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |
| **[AI4EOSC: a Federated Cloud Platform for Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16455v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we describe a federated compute platform dedicated to support Artificial Intelligence in scientific workloads. Putting the effort into reproducible deployments, it delivers consistent, transparent access to a federation of physically distributed e-Infrastructures. Through a comprehensive service catalogue, the platform is able to offer an integrated user experience covering the full Machine Learning lifecycle, including model development (with dedicated interactive development environments), training (with GPU resources, annotation tools, experiment tracking, and federated learning support) and deployment (covering a wide range of deployment options all along the Cloud Continuum). The platform also provides tools for traceability and reproducibility of AI models, integrates with different Artificial Intelligence model providers, datasets and storage resources, allowing users to interact with the broader Machine Learning ecosystem. Finally, it is easily customizable to lower the adoption barrier by external communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular abstract syntax trees (MAST): substitution tensors with second-class sorts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03946v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kascade: A Practical Sparse Attention Method for Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16391v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables and 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures; the affiliation of some authors is updated in this version</p></details> |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexKV: Flexible Index Offloading for Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16148v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Optimizing Disaggregated Transactions with Disaggregated Locks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16136v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently. To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Staggered Batch Scheduling: Co-optimizing Time-to-First-Token and Throughput for High-Efficiency LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16134v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) serving towards complex, distributed architectures--specifically the P/D-separated, large-scale DP+EP paradigm--introduces distinct scheduling challenges. Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Online Fragmentation-Aware Scheduler for Managing GPU-Sharing Workloads on Multi-Instance GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16099v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design. Availability: The research artifact is publicly accessible for future studies and improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks.

Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |
| **[Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16813v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</p></details> |  |

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Efficient Bitcoin Meta-Protocol Transaction and Data Discovery Through nLockTime Field Repurposing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16683v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe the Lockchain Protocol, a lightweight Bitcoin meta-protocol that enables highly efficient transaction discovery at zero marginal block space cost, and data verification without introducing any new on-chain storage mechanism. The protocol repurposes the mandatory 4-byte nLockTime field of every Bitcoin transaction as a compact metadata header. By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even-Cycle Detection in the Randomized and Quantum CONGEST Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12018v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the \CONGEST{} model by a randomized Monte-Carlo distributed algorithm with one-sided error probability $1/3$. This matches the best round-complexities of previously known algorithms for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$ by Drucker et al. [PODC'14] and Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'20], but improves the complexities of the known algorithms for $k>5$ by Eden et al. [DISC'19], which were essentially of the form $\tilde O(n^{1-2/k^2})$. Our algorithm uses colored BFS-explorations with threshold, but with an original \emph{global} approach that enables to overcome a recent impossibility result by Fraigniaud et al. [SIROCCO'23] about using colored BFS-exploration with \emph{local} threshold for detecting cycles. We also show how to quantize our algorithm for achieving a round-complexity $\tilde O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ in the quantum setting for deciding $C_{2k}$ freeness. Furthermore, this allows us to improve the known quantum complexities of the simpler problem of detecting cycles of length \emph{at most}~$2k$ by van Apeldoorn and de Vos [PODC'22]. Our quantization is in two steps. First, the congestion of our randomized algorithm is reduced, to the cost of reducing its success probability too. Second, the success probability is boosted using a new quantum framework derived from sequential algorithms, namely Monte-Carlo quantum amplification.</p></details> |  |

Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving. Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source at https://github.com/cornserve-ai/cornserve</p></details> |

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |

These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV.</p></details> |  |

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables and 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures; the affiliation of some authors is updated in this version</p></details> |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexKV: Flexible Index Offloading for Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16148v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Optimizing Disaggregated Transactions with Disaggregated Locks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16136v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently. To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Online Fragmentation-Aware Scheduler for Managing GPU-Sharing Workloads on Multi-Instance GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16099v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design.

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Upper Bound on the M/M/k Queue With Deterministic Setup Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16854v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many systems, servers do not turn on instantly; instead, a setup time must pass before a server can begin work. These "setup times" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues. Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST.</p></details> |  |

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade. Our experiments show that M-ESU/H yields up to 21.57% improvement in task satisfaction under identical budget and demand growth conditions, confirming its scalability and practical value for long-term MEC systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

By constraining values to an unused range of past Unix timestamps greater than or equal to 500,000,000, the field can encode a protocol signal, type, variant, and sequence identifier while remaining fully valid under Bitcoin consensus and policy rules. The primary contribution of the protocol is an efficient discovery layer. Indexers can filter candidate transactions by examining a fixed-size header field, independent of transaction payload size, and only then selectively inspect heavier data such as OP RETURN outputs or witness fields. The Lockchain Protocol applies established protocol design patterns to an under-optimised problem domain, namely transaction discovery at scale, and does not claim new cryptographic primitives or storage methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Even-Cycle Detection in the Randomized and Quantum CONGEST Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12018v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that, for every $k\geq 2$, $C_{2k}$-freeness can be decided in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds in the \CONGEST{} model by a randomized Monte-Carlo distributed algorithm with one-sided error probability $1/3$. This matches the best round-complexities of previously known algorithms for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$ by Drucker et al. [PODC'14] and Censor-Hillel et al. [DISC'20], but improves the complexities of the known algorithms for $k>5$ by Eden et al. [DISC'19], which were essentially of the form $\tilde O(n^{1-2/k^2})$. Our algorithm uses colored BFS-explorations with threshold, but with an original \emph{global} approach that enables to overcome a recent impossibility result by Fraigniaud et al. [SIROCCO'23] about using colored BFS-exploration with \emph{local} threshold for detecting cycles. We also show how to quantize our algorithm for achieving a round-complexity $\tilde O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2k}})$ in the quantum setting for deciding $C_{2k}$ freeness. Furthermore, this allows us to improve the known quantum complexities of the simpler problem of detecting cycles of length \emph{at most}~$2k$ by van Apeldoorn and de Vos [PODC'22]. Our quantization is in two steps. First, the congestion of our randomized algorithm is reduced, to the cost of reducing its success probability too. Second, the success probability is boosted using a new quantum framework derived from sequential algorithms, namely Monte-Carlo quantum amplification.</p></details> |  |

Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving. Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source at https://github.com/cornserve-ai/cornserve</p></details> |

However, existing scheduling languages are locked into specific compiler ecosystems, preventing fair comparison, reuse, and evaluation across frameworks. No unified interface currently decouples scheduling specification from code generation and measurement. We introduce XTC, a platform that unifies scheduling and performance evaluation across compilers. With its common API and reproducible measurement framework, XTC enables portable experimentation and accelerates research on optimization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient CPU-GPU Collaborative Inference for MoE-based LLMs on Memory-Limited Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16473v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various tasks, yet their high computational demands pose deployment challenges, especially on consumer-grade hardware. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models provide an efficient solution through selective activation of parameter subsets, which reduces computation requirements. Despite this efficiency, state-of-the-art MoE models still require substantial memory beyond typical consumer GPU capacities. Traditional offloading methods that transfer model weights between CPU and GPU introduce latency, limiting inference performance. This paper presents a novel CPU-GPU collaborative inference framework that incorporates an expert caching mechanism on the GPU to reduce data transfer requirements and enable faster inference through cache hits. Computations are offloaded to CPU for efficient cache miss handling, which benefits from CPU multithreading optimizations. The evaluations of our framework demonstrate performance improvements and highlight the potential of CPU-GPU collaboration to maximize hardware utilization for single-request inference scenarios on consumer-grade systems. The implementation of our framework is available at https://github.com/elsa-lab/MoE-CPU-GPU-Collaborative-Inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |

These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kascade: A Practical Sparse Attention Method for Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16391v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables and 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures; the affiliation of some authors is updated in this version</p></details> |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexKV: Flexible Index Offloading for Memory-Disaggregated Key-Value Store](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16148v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) is a promising data center architecture that decouples CPU and memory into independent resource pools to improve resource utilization. Building on DM, memory-disaggregated key-value (KV) stores are adopted to efficiently manage remote data. Unfortunately, existing approaches suffer from poor performance due to two critical issues: 1) the overdependence on one-sided atomic operations in index processing, and 2) the constrained efficiency in compute-side caches. To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead. FlexKV proposes: 1) a rank-aware hotness detection algorithm to continuously balance index load across compute nodes, 2) a two-level CN memory optimization scheme to efficiently utilize compute node memory, and 3) an RPC-aggregated cache management mechanism to reduce cache coherence overhead. The experimental results show that FlexKV improves throughput by up to 2.94$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 85.2%, compared with the state-of-the-art memory-disaggregated KV stores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Optimizing Disaggregated Transactions with Disaggregated Locks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16136v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources, allowing flexible scaling to achieve high resource utilization. To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently. To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Staggered Batch Scheduling: Co-optimizing Time-to-First-Token and Throughput for High-Efficiency LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16134v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) serving towards complex, distributed architectures--specifically the P/D-separated, large-scale DP+EP paradigm--introduces distinct scheduling challenges. Unlike traditional deployments where schedulers can treat instances as black boxes, DP+EP architectures exhibit high internal synchronization costs. We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases. Deployed on a production H800 cluster serving Deepseek-V3, our system reduces TTFT by 30%-40% and improves throughput by 15%-20% compared to state-of-the-art immediate scheduling baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Online Fragmentation-Aware Scheduler for Managing GPU-Sharing Workloads on Multi-Instance GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16099v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern GPU workloads increasingly demand efficient resource sharing, as many jobs do not require the full capacity of a GPU. Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Cold-Start Anti-Patterns and Refactorings in Serverless Systems: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16066v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing simplifies deployment and scaling, yet cold-start latency remains a major performance bottleneck. Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design. Availability: The research artifact is publicly accessible for future studies and improvements.</p></details> |  |
