| **[Fail Fast, Win Big: Rethinking the Drafting Strategy in Speculative Decoding via Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20573v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Minimalist Proof Language for Neural Theorem Proving over Isabelle/HOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18885v4)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) employs LLMs to automate formal proofs in proof assistants. While LLMs have achieved relatively remarkable success in informal reasoning tasks using natural languages, the transition to mechanized formal theorem proving presents persistent challenges. Mechanized proof languages often contain many syntactic constructs and diverse, specialized proof tactics, which facilitate expert use but have no direct counterpart in informal mathematical proofs. These prover-specific idioms represent an additional burden for LLM-based NTPs that might be otherwise successful in generating informal proofs. Seeking to bridge this gap between formal proof construction and informal reasoning, in order to better facilitate NTP, this work approaches these challenges from a language design perspective. We look at common reasoning patterns in informal proofs and in existing mechanized proofs, and design Minilang -- a minimalist proof language that captures these reasoning patterns. In contrast to proof languages (informal and formal) that often feature a large collection of operations with unclear semantic boundaries, Minilang is deliberately kept minimalist -- its core design comprises only 10 operations, each with clear semantic distinctions. We further develop a rule-based translator from Isabelle's language (Isar) to Minilang, translating ~340K existing proofs with an ~85% success rate. Using this translated corpus, we finetune two LLMs to compare machine learning performance on Minilang versus the original Isar. Experiments show Minilang benefits the two LLMs by improving the pass@1 success rate on the PISA benchmark by up to 20/29 percentage points in comparison to the Isar-based LLMs w/wo Sledgehammer. The pass@1 rate reaches 69.1%, exceeding the prior work Baldur's pass@64 (65.7%); the pass@8 rate reaches 79.2%, exceeding the SOTA on PISA (71.0%) achieved by Magnushammer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in OOPSLA'26</p></details> |
| **[WOC: Dual-Path Weighted Object Consensus Made Efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20485v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern distributed systems face a critical challenge: existing consensus protocols optimize for either node heterogeneity or workload independence, but not both. For example, Cabinet leverages weighted quorums to handle node heterogeneity but serializes all operations through a global leader, limiting parallelism. EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Becoming Immutable: How Ethereum is Made](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04940v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain's economic value lies in enabling financial and economic transactions that do not require trusted, centralized intermediaries. In practice, however, transactions must pass through several intermediaries before being included on-chain. We study empirically whether this process undermines blockchain's stated benefits by assembling a novel dataset of 15,097 non-winning Ethereum blocks--blocks proposed by builders but not ultimately selected for inclusion. We show that 21% of user transactions are delayed: although proposed in some candidate blocks, they are not included in the winning block. Approximately 30% of these delayed transactions are exclusive to a single losing builder, indicating that transaction routing materially affect inclusion outcomes. We further document substantial heterogeneity in execution quality: both the probability of successful execution and the execution price of users' swaps vary across candidate blocks. Finally, we study two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). We document intense competition for the same arbitrage opportunities and estimate that these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on centralized exchanges at prices approximately 2.8 basis points more favorable than contemporaneous Binance prices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Automated In-Isolation Validation in Repository-Level Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21878v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code translation aims to migrate entire repositories across programming languages while preserving functionality automatically. Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmaries: Automatic Inference of Formal Security Summaries for Java Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20396v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a scalable, modular, and sound approach for automatically constructing formal security specifications for Java bytecode programs in the form of method summaries. A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Packet Forwarding: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Routing in Gaussian Interconnected Networks with Clustered Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20394v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies</p></details> |  |
| **[Clust-PSI-PFL: A Population Stability Index Approach for Clustered Non-IID Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20363v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to the 40th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Post-Quantum Cryptography in the 5G Core](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20243v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, the conventional cryptographic algorithms used in the 5G Core are replaced with post-quantum alternatives and the practical impact of this transition is evaluated. Using a simulation environment, we model the registration and deregistration of varying numbers of user equipments (UEs) and measure the resulting effects on bandwidth consumption and latency. Our results show that the deployment of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms has a measurable effect on performance, but that this effect is small, and perhaps more crucially, that the extra overhead needed in terms of computation and bandwidth does not have any substantial impact on the usability of the network and the efficiency of its network functions. Overall the experimental results in this work corroborate earlier research: the 5G Core is technically able to support post-quantum cryptography without any inherent issues connected to the increased computational overhead or larger message size.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Error Localization, Certificates, and Hints for Probabilistic Program Verification via Slicing (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20214v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on effective user diagnostics generated during the deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints. We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive-LoRA: A Proactive and Fragmentation-Aware Serverless Inference System for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20210v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless computing paradigm offers compelling advantages for deploying Large Language Model (LLM) inference services, including elastic scaling and pay-per-use billing. However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast LLM Post-training via Decoupled and Fastest-of-N Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16193v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. This work, SpecActor, achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast draft path to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges that hinder speculation efficiency: (1) a Decoupled speculation method that overcomes the computation inefficiency issue when executing speculative decoding with relative large per-worker batch size -- a common configuration in training but unfriendly to speculation, and (2) a Fastest-of-N speculation method that selects and combines different draft methods according to the rollout progress to approximate the optimal draft method even when the best one is unknown a priori. Extensive evaluations on production traces show that SpecActor accelerates mean rollout speed by 2.0--2.4x, with up to 2.7x speedup, over common post-training baselines. The results are consistent across both dense and MoE models and across different RL algorithms. Notably, SpecActor is 1.1--2.6x faster compared to vanilla speculative rollout in different traces. The accelerated rollout achieves 1.4--2.3x faster end-to-end training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem. To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHIRO: Near-Optimal Communication Strategies for Distributed Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20178v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous high-performance computing and deep learning applications. The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Population Protocols Revisited: Parity and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20163v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$. Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastMPS: Revisit Data Parallel in Large-scale Matrix Product State Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20064v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix Product State (MPS) is a versatile tensor network representation widely applied in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and machine learning, etc. MPS sampling serves as a critical fundamental operation in these fields. As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |

Existing systems are tightly coupled to a specific PBDR method. And they suffer from severe communication overhead due to poor data locality. In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms. Our implementations achieve high performance and resource efficiency: across six datasets and up to 128 GPUs, it reduces communication by up to 91% and improves training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages main text, plus appendix</p></details> |

DeepSeek-V3, trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient training and inference at scale. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory efficiency, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for optimized computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units, scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the work.

| **[Rethinking Knowledge Distillation in Collaborative Machine Learning: Memory, Knowledge, and Their Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19972v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative learning has emerged as a key paradigm in large-scale intelligent systems, enabling distributed agents to cooperatively train their models while addressing their privacy concerns. Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE TNSE</p></details> |

However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and often produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees. We propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust translation tool that employs a two-step process: an initial "unidiomatic" translation to preserve semantics, followed by an "idiomatic" refinement to align with Rust standards. To validate correctness of our function-wise incremental translation that mixes C and Rust, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface. We evaluate SACTOR on 200 programs from two public datasets and on two more real-world scenarios (a 50-sample subset of CRust-Bench and the libogg library), comparing multiple LLMs. Across datasets, SACTOR delivers high end-to-end correctness and produces safe, idiomatic Rust with up to 7 times fewer Clippy warnings; On CRust-Bench, SACTOR achieves an average (across samples) of 85% unidiomatic and 52% idiomatic success, and on libogg it attains full unidiomatic and up to 78% idiomatic coverage on GPT-5.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures Previously named as "LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis"</p></details> |

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

While LLMs have achieved relatively remarkable success in informal reasoning tasks using natural languages, the transition to mechanized formal theorem proving presents persistent challenges. Mechanized proof languages often contain many syntactic constructs and diverse, specialized proof tactics, which facilitate expert use but have no direct counterpart in informal mathematical proofs. These prover-specific idioms represent an additional burden for LLM-based NTPs that might be otherwise successful in generating informal proofs. Seeking to bridge this gap between formal proof construction and informal reasoning, in order to better facilitate NTP, this work approaches these challenges from a language design perspective. We look at common reasoning patterns in informal proofs and in existing mechanized proofs, and design Minilang -- a minimalist proof language that captures these reasoning patterns. In contrast to proof languages (informal and formal) that often feature a large collection of operations with unclear semantic boundaries, Minilang is deliberately kept minimalist -- its core design comprises only 10 operations, each with clear semantic distinctions. We further develop a rule-based translator from Isabelle's language (Isar) to Minilang, translating ~340K existing proofs with an ~85% success rate. Using this translated corpus, we finetune two LLMs to compare machine learning performance on Minilang versus the original Isar. Experiments show Minilang benefits the two LLMs by improving the pass@1 success rate on the PISA benchmark by up to 20/29 percentage points in comparison to the Isar-based LLMs w/wo Sledgehammer.

For example, Cabinet leverages weighted quorums to handle node heterogeneity but serializes all operations through a global leader, limiting parallelism. EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention.</p></details> |  |

In practice, however, transactions must pass through several intermediaries before being included on-chain. We study empirically whether this process undermines blockchain's stated benefits by assembling a novel dataset of 15,097 non-winning Ethereum blocks--blocks proposed by builders but not ultimately selected for inclusion. We show that 21% of user transactions are delayed: although proposed in some candidate blocks, they are not included in the winning block. Approximately 30% of these delayed transactions are exclusive to a single losing builder, indicating that transaction routing materially affect inclusion outcomes. We further document substantial heterogeneity in execution quality: both the probability of successful execution and the execution price of users' swaps vary across candidate blocks. Finally, we study two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX). We document intense competition for the same arbitrage opportunities and estimate that these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on centralized exchanges at prices approximately 2.8 basis points more favorable than contemporaneous Binance prices.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.</p></details> |  |

A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Packet Forwarding: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Routing in Gaussian Interconnected Networks with Clustered Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20394v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies</p></details> |  |

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to the 40th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2026)</p></details> |

Using a simulation environment, we model the registration and deregistration of varying numbers of user equipments (UEs) and measure the resulting effects on bandwidth consumption and latency. Our results show that the deployment of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms has a measurable effect on performance, but that this effect is small, and perhaps more crucially, that the extra overhead needed in terms of computation and bandwidth does not have any substantial impact on the usability of the network and the efficiency of its network functions. Overall the experimental results in this work corroborate earlier research: the 5G Core is technically able to support post-quantum cryptography without any inherent issues connected to the increased computational overhead or larger message size.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints. We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative.</p></details> |  |

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast LLM Post-training via Decoupled and Fastest-of-N Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16193v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. This work, SpecActor, achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast draft path to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges that hinder speculation efficiency: (1) a Decoupled speculation method that overcomes the computation inefficiency issue when executing speculative decoding with relative large per-worker batch size -- a common configuration in training but unfriendly to speculation, and (2) a Fastest-of-N speculation method that selects and combines different draft methods according to the rollout progress to approximate the optimal draft method even when the best one is unknown a priori. Extensive evaluations on production traces show that SpecActor accelerates mean rollout speed by 2.0--2.4x, with up to 2.7x speedup, over common post-training baselines. The results are consistent across both dense and MoE models and across different RL algorithms. Notably, SpecActor is 1.1--2.6x faster compared to vanilla speculative rollout in different traces. The accelerated rollout achieves 1.4--2.3x faster end-to-end training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem. To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHIRO: Near-Optimal Communication Strategies for Distributed Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20178v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous high-performance computing and deep learning applications. The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Population Protocols Revisited: Parity and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20163v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$. Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.</p></details> |  |

As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |

In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms.

DeepSeek-V3, trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient training and inference at scale.

Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE TNSE</p></details> |

However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and often produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees. We propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust translation tool that employs a two-step process: an initial "unidiomatic" translation to preserve semantics, followed by an "idiomatic" refinement to align with Rust standards. To validate correctness of our function-wise incremental translation that mixes C and Rust, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface. We evaluate SACTOR on 200 programs from two public datasets and on two more real-world scenarios (a 50-sample subset of CRust-Bench and the libogg library), comparing multiple LLMs. Across datasets, SACTOR delivers high end-to-end correctness and produces safe, idiomatic Rust with up to 7 times fewer Clippy warnings; On CRust-Bench, SACTOR achieves an average (across samples) of 85% unidiomatic and 52% idiomatic success, and on libogg it attains full unidiomatic and up to 78% idiomatic coverage on GPT-5.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures Previously named as "LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis"</p></details> |

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have achieved relatively remarkable success in informal reasoning tasks using natural languages, the transition to mechanized formal theorem proving presents persistent challenges. Mechanized proof languages often contain many syntactic constructs and diverse, specialized proof tactics, which facilitate expert use but have no direct counterpart in informal mathematical proofs. These prover-specific idioms represent an additional burden for LLM-based NTPs that might be otherwise successful in generating informal proofs. Seeking to bridge this gap between formal proof construction and informal reasoning, in order to better facilitate NTP, this work approaches these challenges from a language design perspective. We look at common reasoning patterns in informal proofs and in existing mechanized proofs, and design Minilang -- a minimalist proof language that captures these reasoning patterns. In contrast to proof languages (informal and formal) that often feature a large collection of operations with unclear semantic boundaries, Minilang is deliberately kept minimalist -- its core design comprises only 10 operations, each with clear semantic distinctions. We further develop a rule-based translator from Isabelle's language (Isar) to Minilang, translating ~340K existing proofs with an ~85% success rate. Using this translated corpus, we finetune two LLMs to compare machine learning performance on Minilang versus the original Isar. Experiments show Minilang benefits the two LLMs by improving the pass@1 success rate on the PISA benchmark by up to 20/29 percentage points in comparison to the Isar-based LLMs w/wo Sledgehammer. The pass@1 rate reaches 69.1%, exceeding the prior work Baldur's pass@64 (65.7%); the pass@8 rate reaches 79.2%, exceeding the SOTA on PISA (71.0%) achieved by Magnushammer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in OOPSLA'26</p></details> |

Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus.

Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Packet Forwarding: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Routing in Gaussian Interconnected Networks with Clustered Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20394v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies</p></details> |  |
| **[Clust-PSI-PFL: A Population Stability Index Approach for Clustered Non-IID Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20363v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication to the 40th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2026)</p></details> |

Using a simulation environment, we model the registration and deregistration of varying numbers of user equipments (UEs) and measure the resulting effects on bandwidth consumption and latency. Our results show that the deployment of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms has a measurable effect on performance, but that this effect is small, and perhaps more crucially, that the extra overhead needed in terms of computation and bandwidth does not have any substantial impact on the usability of the network and the efficiency of its network functions. Overall the experimental results in this work corroborate earlier research: the 5G Core is technically able to support post-quantum cryptography without any inherent issues connected to the increased computational overhead or larger message size.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Error Localization, Certificates, and Hints for Probabilistic Program Verification via Slicing (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20214v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on effective user diagnostics generated during the deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints. We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive-LoRA: A Proactive and Fragmentation-Aware Serverless Inference System for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20210v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless computing paradigm offers compelling advantages for deploying Large Language Model (LLM) inference services, including elastic scaling and pay-per-use billing. However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast LLM Post-training via Decoupled and Fastest-of-N Speculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16193v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout dominates the training time in large language model (LLM) post-training, where the trained model is used to generate tokens given a batch of prompts. This work, SpecActor, achieves fast rollout with speculative decoding that deploys a fast draft path to accelerate the unparallelizable generation, while the correctness is guaranteed by fast parallel verification of the outputs with the original model. SpecActor addresses two foundational challenges that hinder speculation efficiency: (1) a Decoupled speculation method that overcomes the computation inefficiency issue when executing speculative decoding with relative large per-worker batch size -- a common configuration in training but unfriendly to speculation, and (2) a Fastest-of-N speculation method that selects and combines different draft methods according to the rollout progress to approximate the optimal draft method even when the best one is unknown a priori. Extensive evaluations on production traces show that SpecActor accelerates mean rollout speed by 2.0--2.4x, with up to 2.7x speedup, over common post-training baselines. The results are consistent across both dense and MoE models and across different RL algorithms. Notably, SpecActor is 1.1--2.6x faster compared to vanilla speculative rollout in different traces. The accelerated rollout achieves 1.4--2.3x faster end-to-end training time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem. To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHIRO: Near-Optimal Communication Strategies for Distributed Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20178v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous high-performance computing and deep learning applications. The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Population Protocols Revisited: Parity and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20163v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$. Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.</p></details> |  |

As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 13 figures |

Existing systems are tightly coupled to a specific PBDR method. And they suffer from severe communication overhead due to poor data locality. In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms. Our implementations achieve high performance and resource efficiency: across six datasets and up to 128 GPUs, it reduces communication by up to 91% and improves training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages main text, plus appendix</p></details> |

DeepSeek-V3, trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient training and inference at scale. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory efficiency, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for optimized computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units, scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the work.

| **[Rethinking Knowledge Distillation in Collaborative Machine Learning: Memory, Knowledge, and Their Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19972v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative learning has emerged as a key paradigm in large-scale intelligent systems, enabling distributed agents to cooperatively train their models while addressing their privacy concerns. Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE TNSE</p></details> |

However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and often produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees. We propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust translation tool that employs a two-step process: an initial "unidiomatic" translation to preserve semantics, followed by an "idiomatic" refinement to align with Rust standards. To validate correctness of our function-wise incremental translation that mixes C and Rust, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface. We evaluate SACTOR on 200 programs from two public datasets and on two more real-world scenarios (a 50-sample subset of CRust-Bench and the libogg library), comparing multiple LLMs. Across datasets, SACTOR delivers high end-to-end correctness and produces safe, idiomatic Rust with up to 7 times fewer Clippy warnings; On CRust-Bench, SACTOR achieves an average (across samples) of 85% unidiomatic and 52% idiomatic success, and on libogg it attains full unidiomatic and up to 78% idiomatic coverage on GPT-5.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 15 figures Previously named as "LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis"</p></details> |
