| **[Translating Large-Scale C Repositories to Idiomatic Rust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20617v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing C to Rust translation techniques fail to balance quality and scalability: transpilation-based approaches scale to large projects but produce code with poor safety, idiomaticity, and readability. In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

No existing program logics can express specifications about the full distributions of outcomes resulting from programs that are both probabilistic and concurrent. To address this, we introduce Probabilistic Concurrent Outcome Logic (pcOL), which incorporates ideas from concurrent and probabilistic separation logics into Outcome Logic to introduce new compositional reasoning principles. At its core, pcOL reinterprets the rules of Concurrent Separation Logic in a setting where separation models probabilistic independence, so as to compositionally describe joint distributions over variables in concurrent threads. Reasoning about outcomes also proves crucial, as case analysis is often necessary to derive precise information about threads that rely on randomized shared state. We demonstrate pcOL on a variety of examples, including to prove almost sure termination of unbounded loops.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Parallel Implementation of the Pilot Assignment Problem in Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20511v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assignment of the pilot sequence is a critical challenge in massive MIMO systems, as sharing the same pilot sequence among multiple users causes interference, which degrades the accuracy of the channel estimation. This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>FPGA-...</summary><p>FPGA-based denoising pipeline for PRISM-scale imaging.

| **[Minimmit: Fast Finality with Even Faster Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving low-latency consensus in geographically distributed systems remains a key challenge for blockchain and distributed database applications. To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting). We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

The prototype is easy to set up and is intended to function as a completely standalone system, using a local WiFi router for connectivity. It features LCD screens for visualization of the local state of blockchain ledgers on each RPi, making it ideal for educational purposes and to demonstrate fundamental blockchain concepts to a wide audience. For example, a functioning PoW consensus is easily visible from the LCD screens, as well as consensus degradation which might arise from various factors, including peer-to-peer topology and communication latency - all parameters which can be configured from the central web-based interface.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Lazy Linearity for a Core Functional Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10361v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, in linearly typed languages, consuming a linear resource is synonymous with its syntactic occurrence in the program. However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core. We have implemented Linear Core as a compiler plugin to validate the system against linearity-heavy libraries, including linear-base.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of POPL 2026 paper</p></details> |

Generating correctness certificates for correct programs allows for efficient independent validation of verification results, and thus helps to reveal such bugs. Automatic generation of small, compact correctness proofs for concurrent programs is challenging, as the correctness arguments may depend on the particular interleaving, which can lead to exponential explosion. We present an approach that converts an interleaving-based correctness proof, as generated by many algorithmic verifiers, into a thread-modular correctness proof in the style of Owicki and Gries. We automatically synthesize ghost variables that capture the relevant interleaving information, and abstract away irrelevant details. Our evaluation shows that the approach is efficient in practice and generates compact proofs, compared to a baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hadamard-Pi: Equational Quantum Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $Π$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | <details><summary>116 p...</summary><p>116 pages; v2: Extended version of POPL 2026 publication</p></details> |
| **[Beluga: A CXL-Based Memory Architecture for Scalable and Efficient LLM KVCache Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20172v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by SIGMOD'26</p></details> |
| **[BackFed: An Efficient & Standardized Benchmark Suite for Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04903v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) has accelerated in recent years, with new attacks and defenses continually proposed in an escalating arms race. However, the evaluation of these methods remains neither standardized nor reliable. First, there are severe inconsistencies in the evaluation settings across studies, and many rely on unrealistic threat models. Second, our code review uncovers semantic bugs in the official codebases of several attacks that artificially inflate their reported performance. These issues raise fundamental questions about whether current methods are truly effective or simply overfitted to narrow experimental setups. We introduce \textbf{BackFed}, a benchmark designed to standardize and stress-test FL backdoor evaluation by unifying attacks and defenses under a common evaluation framework that mirrors realistic FL deployments. Our benchmark on three representative datasets with three distinct architectures reveals critical limitations of existing methods. Malicious clients often require excessive training time and computation, making them vulnerable to server-enforced time constraints. Meanwhile, several defenses incur severe accuracy degradation or aggregation overhead. Popular defenses and attacks achieve limited performance in our benchmark, which challenges their previous efficacy claims. We establish BackFed as a rigorous and fair evaluation framework that enables more reliable progress in FL backdoor research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our f...</summary><p>Our framework is openly available at https://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed</p></details> |
| **[Parallel simulation and adaptive mesh refinement for 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems between deformable bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20142v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel implementation of numerical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)strategies for solving 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems is an essential step toward complex simulations that exceed current performance levels. This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-Kernel: Macro-Thinking Micro-Coding Paradigm for LLM-Based High-Performance GPU Kernel Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20100v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p></details> |  |

It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted by ICDE'26</p></details> |

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.</p></details> | 28 pages |

To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting). We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |

In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $Π$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | <details><summary>116 p...</summary><p>116 pages; v2: Extended version of POPL 2026 publication</p></details> |

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by SIGMOD'26</p></details> |

However, the evaluation of these methods remains neither standardized nor reliable. First, there are severe inconsistencies in the evaluation settings across studies, and many rely on unrealistic threat models. Second, our code review uncovers semantic bugs in the official codebases of several attacks that artificially inflate their reported performance. These issues raise fundamental questions about whether current methods are truly effective or simply overfitted to narrow experimental setups. We introduce \textbf{BackFed}, a benchmark designed to standardize and stress-test FL backdoor evaluation by unifying attacks and defenses under a common evaluation framework that mirrors realistic FL deployments. Our benchmark on three representative datasets with three distinct architectures reveals critical limitations of existing methods. Malicious clients often require excessive training time and computation, making them vulnerable to server-enforced time constraints. Meanwhile, several defenses incur severe accuracy degradation or aggregation overhead. Popular defenses and attacks achieve limited performance in our benchmark, which challenges their previous efficacy claims. We establish BackFed as a rigorous and fair evaluation framework that enables more reliable progress in FL backdoor research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our f...</summary><p>Our framework is openly available at https://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed</p></details> |

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p></details> |  |

It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted by ICDE'26</p></details> |

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.</p></details> | 28 pages |

In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

No existing program logics can express specifications about the full distributions of outcomes resulting from programs that are both probabilistic and concurrent. To address this, we introduce Probabilistic Concurrent Outcome Logic (pcOL), which incorporates ideas from concurrent and probabilistic separation logics into Outcome Logic to introduce new compositional reasoning principles. At its core, pcOL reinterprets the rules of Concurrent Separation Logic in a setting where separation models probabilistic independence, so as to compositionally describe joint distributions over variables in concurrent threads. Reasoning about outcomes also proves crucial, as case analysis is often necessary to derive precise information about threads that rely on randomized shared state. We demonstrate pcOL on a variety of examples, including to prove almost sure termination of unbounded loops.</p></details> |  |

This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)</p></details> |  |

Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |

Automatic generation of small, compact correctness proofs for concurrent programs is challenging, as the correctness arguments may depend on the particular interleaving, which can lead to exponential explosion. We present an approach that converts an interleaving-based correctness proof, as generated by many algorithmic verifiers, into a thread-modular correctness proof in the style of Owicki and Gries. We automatically synthesize ghost variables that capture the relevant interleaving information, and abstract away irrelevant details. Our evaluation shows that the approach is efficient in practice and generates compact proofs, compared to a baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hadamard-Pi: Equational Quantum Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $Π$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | <details><summary>116 p...</summary><p>116 pages; v2: Extended version of POPL 2026 publication</p></details> |
| **[Beluga: A CXL-Based Memory Architecture for Scalable and Efficient LLM KVCache Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20172v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by SIGMOD'26</p></details> |
| **[BackFed: An Efficient & Standardized Benchmark Suite for Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04903v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) has accelerated in recent years, with new attacks and defenses continually proposed in an escalating arms race. However, the evaluation of these methods remains neither standardized nor reliable. First, there are severe inconsistencies in the evaluation settings across studies, and many rely on unrealistic threat models. Second, our code review uncovers semantic bugs in the official codebases of several attacks that artificially inflate their reported performance. These issues raise fundamental questions about whether current methods are truly effective or simply overfitted to narrow experimental setups. We introduce \textbf{BackFed}, a benchmark designed to standardize and stress-test FL backdoor evaluation by unifying attacks and defenses under a common evaluation framework that mirrors realistic FL deployments. Our benchmark on three representative datasets with three distinct architectures reveals critical limitations of existing methods. Malicious clients often require excessive training time and computation, making them vulnerable to server-enforced time constraints. Meanwhile, several defenses incur severe accuracy degradation or aggregation overhead. Popular defenses and attacks achieve limited performance in our benchmark, which challenges their previous efficacy claims. We establish BackFed as a rigorous and fair evaluation framework that enables more reliable progress in FL backdoor research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our f...</summary><p>Our framework is openly available at https://github.com/thinh-dao/BackFed</p></details> |

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-Kernel: Macro-Thinking Micro-Coding Paradigm for LLM-Based High-Performance GPU Kernel Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20100v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-CRUX: Narrowing the Gap between Natural Language and Verilog via Core Refined Understanding eXpression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20099v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Latency of LLM Search Agent via Speculation-based Algorithm-System Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20048v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based search agents achieve strong performance but suffer from severe latency, as each step requires serialized LLM reasoning followed by action of tool execution. We revisit this bottleneck through the lens of speculation. While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAlloc: Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large-Scale Model Training with Spatio-Temporal Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16274v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased GPU memory pressure, which is further aggravated by training optimization techniques such as virtual pipeline and recomputation that disrupt tensor lifespans and introduce considerable memory fragmentation. Such fragmentation stems from the use of online GPU memory allocators in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which disregard tensor lifespans. As a result, this inefficiency can waste as much as 43% of memory and trigger out-of-memory errors, undermining the effectiveness of optimization methods. To address this, we introduce STAlloc, a GPU memory allocator for deep learning frameworks that reduces fragmentation by exploiting the spatial and temporal regularity in memory allocation behaviors of training workloads. STAlloc introduces a novel paradigm that combines offline planning with online allocation. The offline planning leverages spatio-temporal regularities to generate a near-optimal allocation plan, while the online allocation handles complex and dynamic models such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Built as a pluggable PyTorch memory allocator, STAlloc reduces fragmentation ratio on average by 85.1% (up to 100%) across both dense and MoE models, with negligible overhead. This enables more efficient, high-throughput training configurations and improves throughput performance by up to 32.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwitchDelta: Asynchronous Metadata Updating for Distributed Storage with In-Network Data Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19978v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed storage systems typically maintain strong consistency between data nodes and metadata nodes by adopting ordered writes: 1) first installing data; 2) then updating metadata to make data visible.We propose SwitchDelta to accelerate ordered writes by moving metadata updates out of the critical path. It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted by ICDE'26</p></details> |
| **[Stragglers Can Contribute More: Uncertainty-Aware Distillation for Asynchronous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19966v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous federated learning (FL) has recently gained attention for its enhanced efficiency and scalability, enabling local clients to send model updates to the server at their own pace without waiting for slower participants. However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data.</p></details> | 28 pages |
