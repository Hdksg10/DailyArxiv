| **[Beyond Single-GPU: Scaling PDLP to Distributed Multi-GPU Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07628v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm for solving massive-scale linear programming (LP) problems. Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Distr...</summary><p>Distributed PDLP For Improve PDLP Efficiency</p></details> |
| **[Peformance Isolation for Inference Processes in Edge GPU Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07600v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyzes the main isolation mechanisms available in modern NVIDIA GPUs: MPS, MIG, and the recent Green Contexts, to ensure predictable inference time in safety-critical applications using deep learning models. The experimental methodology includes performance tests, evaluation of partitioning impact, and analysis of temporal isolation between processes, considering both the NVIDIA A100 and Jetson Orin platforms. It is observed that MIG provides a high level of isolation. At the same time, Green Contexts represent a promising alternative for edge devices by enabling fine-grained SM allocation with low overhead, albeit without memory isolation. The study also identifies current limitations and outlines potential research directions to improve temporal predictability in shared GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MegaFlow: Large-Scale Distributed Orchestration System for the Agentic Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07526v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of interactive and autonomous AI systems signals our entry into the agentic era. Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-dimensional Autoscaling of Processing Services: A Comparison of Agent-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10420v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.</p></details> |  |

By showcasing these astronomy work, we demonstrate that achieving reproducible science in the Big Data era is feasible. However, we conclude that for the SKAO to succeed, the development of the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) must explicitly incorporate these reproducibility requirements into its fundamental architectural design. Embedding these standards is crucial to enable the global community to conduct verifiable and sustainable research within a federated environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures.

| **[OpenTinker: Separating Concerns in Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07376v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OpenTinker, an infrastructure for reinforcement learning (RL) of large language model (LLM) agents built around a separation of concerns across algorithm design, execution, and agent-environment interaction. Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modern Middlewares for Automated Vehicles: A Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07817v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper offers a tutorial on current middlewares in automated vehicles. Our aim is to provide the reader with an overview of current middlewares and to identify open challenges in this field. We start by explaining the fundamentals of software architecture in distributed systems and the distinguishing requirements of Automated Vehicles. We then distinguish between communication middlewares and architecture platforms and highlight their key principles and differences. Next, we present five state-of-the-art middlewares as well as their capabilities and functions. We explore how these middlewares could be applied in the design of future vehicle software and their role in the automotive domain. Finally, we compare the five middlewares presented and discuss open research challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted and accepted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Bringing Computation to the data: Interoperable serverless function execution for astrophysical data analysis in the SRCNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07308v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a paradigm in which the underlying infrastructure is fully managed by the provider, enabling applications and services to be executed with elastic resource provisioning and minimal operational overhead. A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paris: A Decentralized Trained Open-Weight Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03434v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices present challenges due to high computational demands and energy consumption. Additionally, single LiDAR setups suffer from blind spots. This paper proposes SC-MII, multiple infrastructure LiDAR-based 3D object detection on edge devices for Split Computing with Multiple Intermediate outputs Integration. In SC-MII, edge devices process local point clouds through the initial DNN layers and send intermediate outputs to an edge server. The server integrates these features and completes inference, reducing both latency and device load while improving privacy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show a 2.19x speed-up and a 71.6% reduction in edge device processing time, with at most a 1.09% drop in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[MemFine: Memory-Aware Fine-Grained Scheduling for MoE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21431v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Model Deployment in Multiple Cloud Providers: an Exploratory Study Using Low Computing Power Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23988v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Machine Learning models in the cloud has grown among tech companies. Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning techniques, and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying Deep Learning models, using for experiments the GECToR model, a Deep Learning solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage, and cost at each cloud provider in 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without a GPU. Our analysis also suggests that processor cache memory size is a key variable for CPU-only deployments, and setups with sufficient cache achieved a 50% cost reduction compared to GPU-based deployments. This study indicates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based Deep Learning inference solutions without a GPU, benefiting resource-constrained users such as startups and small research groups.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fail Fast, Win Big: Rethinking the Drafting Strategy in Speculative Decoding via Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20573v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 2.0$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polymorph: Energy-Efficient Multi-Label Classification for Video Streams on Embedded Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14959v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset. Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF winter conference on applications of computer vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Deciding Serializability in Network Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in TACAS 2026</p></details> |

Hapax Locks offer performance (both latency and scalability) that is comparable with the best state of the art locks, while at the same time Hapax Locks impose fewer constraints and dependencies on the ambient runtime environment, making them particularly easy to integrate or retrofit into existing systems or under existing application programming interfaces Of particular note, no pointers shift or escape ownership between threads in our algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divergence-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Byzantine Robust Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06903v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherent client drifts caused by data heterogeneity, as well as vulnerability to Byzantine attacks within the system, hinder effective model training and convergence in federated learning (FL). This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks. We analytically prove that DRAG and BR-DRAG achieve fast convergence for non-convex models under partial worker participation, data heterogeneity, and Byzantine attacks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of DRAG and its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in handling client drifts, and highlight the robustness of BR-DRAG in maintaining resilience against data heterogeneity and diverse Byzantine attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Learning-Augmented Performance Model for Tensor Product Factorization in High-Order FEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06886v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate performance prediction is essential for optimizing scientific applications on modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ReinFog: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Empowered Framework for Resource Management in Edge and Cloud Computing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13121v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing IoT landscape requires effective server deployment strategies to meet demands including real-time processing and energy efficiency. This is complicated by heterogeneous, dynamic applications and servers. To address these challenges, we propose ReinFog, a modular distributed software empowered with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adaptive resource management across edge/fog and cloud environments. ReinFog enables the practical development/deployment of various centralized and distributed DRL techniques for resource management in edge/fog and cloud computing environments. It also supports integrating native and library-based DRL techniques for diverse IoT application scheduling objectives. Additionally, ReinFog allows for customizing deployment configurations for different DRL techniques, including the number and placement of DRL Learners and DRL Workers in large-scale distributed systems. Besides, we propose a novel Memetic Algorithm for DRL Component (e.g., DRL Learners and DRL Workers) Placement in ReinFog named MADCP, which combines the strengths of Genetic Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Experiments reveal that the DRL mechanisms developed within ReinFog have significantly enhanced both centralized and distributed DRL techniques implementation. These advancements have resulted in notable improvements in IoT application performance, reducing response time by 45%, energy consumption by 39%, and weighted cost by 37%, while maintaining minimal scheduling overhead. Additionally, ReinFog exhibits remarkable scalability, with a rise in DRL Workers from 1 to 30 causing only a 0.3-second increase in startup time and around 2 MB more RAM per Worker. The proposed MADCP for DRL component placement further accelerates the convergence rate of DRL techniques by up to 38%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FO-Complete Program Verification for Heap Logics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06719v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the first two heap logics that have implicit heaplets and that admit FO-complete program verification. The notion of FO-completeness is a theoretical guarantee that all theorems that are valid when recursive definitions are interpreted as fixpoint definitions (instead of least fixpoint) are guaranteed to be eventually proven by the system. The logics we develop are a frame logic ($\textit{FL}$) and a separation logic ($\textit{SL-FL}$) that has an alternate semantics inspired by frame logic. We show verification condition generation for FL that is amenable to FO-complete reasoning using quantifier instantiation and SMT solvers. We show $\textit{SL-FL}$ can be translated to FL in order to obtain FO-complete reasoning. We implement tools that realize our technique and show the expressiveness of our logics and the efficacy of the verification technique on a suite of benchmarks that manipulate data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in OOPSLA '25</p></details> |

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.</p></details> |  |

Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</p></details> |  |

This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Hardware requirements are higher when these models involve Deep Learning techniques, and the cloud providers' costs may be a barrier. We explore deploying Deep Learning models, using for experiments the GECToR model, a Deep Learning solution for Grammatical Error Correction, across three of the major cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure). We evaluate real-time latency, hardware usage, and cost at each cloud provider in 7 execution environments with 10 experiments reproduced. We found that while Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without a GPU. Our analysis also suggests that processor cache memory size is a key variable for CPU-only deployments, and setups with sufficient cache achieved a 50% cost reduction compared to GPU-based deployments. This study indicates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based Deep Learning inference solutions without a GPU, benefiting resource-constrained users such as startups and small research groups.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fail Fast, Win Big: Rethinking the Drafting Strategy in Speculative Decoding via Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20573v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 2.0$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.</p></details> |  |

Yet, video streams exhibit structural properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset. Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF winter conference on applications of computer vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |

SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in TACAS 2026</p></details> |

Hapax Locks offer performance (both latency and scalability) that is comparable with the best state of the art locks, while at the same time Hapax Locks impose fewer constraints and dependencies on the ambient runtime environment, making them particularly easy to integrate or retrofit into existing systems or under existing application programming interfaces Of particular note, no pointers shift or escape ownership between threads in our algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divergence-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Byzantine Robust Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06903v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherent client drifts caused by data heterogeneity, as well as vulnerability to Byzantine attacks within the system, hinder effective model training and convergence in federated learning (FL). This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks. We analytically prove that DRAG and BR-DRAG achieve fast convergence for non-convex models under partial worker participation, data heterogeneity, and Byzantine attacks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of DRAG and its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in handling client drifts, and highlight the robustness of BR-DRAG in maintaining resilience against data heterogeneity and diverse Byzantine attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Learning-Augmented Performance Model for Tensor Product Factorization in High-Order FEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06886v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate performance prediction is essential for optimizing scientific applications on modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This is complicated by heterogeneous, dynamic applications and servers. To address these challenges, we propose ReinFog, a modular distributed software empowered with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adaptive resource management across edge/fog and cloud environments. ReinFog enables the practical development/deployment of various centralized and distributed DRL techniques for resource management in edge/fog and cloud computing environments. It also supports integrating native and library-based DRL techniques for diverse IoT application scheduling objectives. Additionally, ReinFog allows for customizing deployment configurations for different DRL techniques, including the number and placement of DRL Learners and DRL Workers in large-scale distributed systems. Besides, we propose a novel Memetic Algorithm for DRL Component (e.g., DRL Learners and DRL Workers) Placement in ReinFog named MADCP, which combines the strengths of Genetic Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Experiments reveal that the DRL mechanisms developed within ReinFog have significantly enhanced both centralized and distributed DRL techniques implementation. These advancements have resulted in notable improvements in IoT application performance, reducing response time by 45%, energy consumption by 39%, and weighted cost by 37%, while maintaining minimal scheduling overhead. Additionally, ReinFog exhibits remarkable scalability, with a rise in DRL Workers from 1 to 30 causing only a 0.3-second increase in startup time and around 2 MB more RAM per Worker. The proposed MADCP for DRL component placement further accelerates the convergence rate of DRL techniques by up to 38%.</p></details> |  |

The notion of FO-completeness is a theoretical guarantee that all theorems that are valid when recursive definitions are interpreted as fixpoint definitions (instead of least fixpoint) are guaranteed to be eventually proven by the system. The logics we develop are a frame logic ($\textit{FL}$) and a separation logic ($\textit{SL-FL}$) that has an alternate semantics inspired by frame logic. We show verification condition generation for FL that is amenable to FO-complete reasoning using quantifier instantiation and SMT solvers. We show $\textit{SL-FL}$ can be translated to FL in order to obtain FO-complete reasoning. We implement tools that realize our technique and show the expressiveness of our logics and the efficacy of the verification technique on a suite of benchmarks that manipulate data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in OOPSLA '25</p></details> |

Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Distr...</summary><p>Distributed PDLP For Improve PDLP Efficiency</p></details> |

The experimental methodology includes performance tests, evaluation of partitioning impact, and analysis of temporal isolation between processes, considering both the NVIDIA A100 and Jetson Orin platforms. It is observed that MIG provides a high level of isolation. At the same time, Green Contexts represent a promising alternative for edge devices by enabling fine-grained SM allocation with low overhead, albeit without memory isolation. The study also identifies current limitations and outlines potential research directions to improve temporal predictability in shared GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Training and evaluating agents on complex agentic tasks such as software engineering and computer use requires not only efficient model computation but also sophisticated infrastructure capable of coordinating vast agent-environment interactions. However, no open-source infrastructure can effectively support large-scale training and evaluation on such complex agentic tasks. To address this challenge, we present MegaFlow, a large-scale distributed orchestration system that enables efficient scheduling, resource allocation, and fine-grained task management for agent-environment workloads. MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations. In our agent training deployments, MegaFlow successfully orchestrates tens of thousands of concurrent agent tasks while maintaining high system stability and achieving efficient resource utilization. By enabling such large-scale agent training, MegaFlow addresses a critical infrastructure gap in the emerging agentic AI landscape.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.</p></details> |  |

Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We found that while Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) excel in performance, they had an average cost 300% higher than solutions without a GPU. Our analysis also suggests that processor cache memory size is a key variable for CPU-only deployments, and setups with sufficient cache achieved a 50% cost reduction compared to GPU-based deployments. This study indicates the feasibility and affordability of cloud-based Deep Learning inference solutions without a GPU, benefiting resource-constrained users such as startups and small research groups.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fail Fast, Win Big: Rethinking the Drafting Strategy in Speculative Decoding via Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20573v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 2.0$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polymorph: Energy-Efficient Multi-Label Classification for Video Streams on Embedded Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14959v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset. Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF winter conference on applications of computer vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Deciding Serializability in Network Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02251v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the SER modeling language for automatically verifying serializability of concurrent programs, i.e., whether every concurrent execution of the program is equivalent to some serial execution. SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in TACAS 2026</p></details> |
| **[Hapax Locks : Value-Based Mutual Exclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14608v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Hapax Locks, a novel locking algorithm that is simple, enjoys constant-time arrival and unlock paths, provides FIFO admission order, and which is also space efficient and generates relatively little coherence traffic under contention in the common case. Hapax Locks offer performance (both latency and scalability) that is comparable with the best state of the art locks, while at the same time Hapax Locks impose fewer constraints and dependencies on the ambient runtime environment, making them particularly easy to integrate or retrofit into existing systems or under existing application programming interfaces Of particular note, no pointers shift or escape ownership between threads in our algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divergence-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Byzantine Robust Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06903v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inherent client drifts caused by data heterogeneity, as well as vulnerability to Byzantine attacks within the system, hinder effective model training and convergence in federated learning (FL). This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions. The workers' updates can be then calibrated to mitigate divergence caused by malicious attacks. We analytically prove that DRAG and BR-DRAG achieve fast convergence for non-convex models under partial worker participation, data heterogeneity, and Byzantine attacks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of DRAG and its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in handling client drifts, and highlight the robustness of BR-DRAG in maintaining resilience against data heterogeneity and diverse Byzantine attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Learning-Augmented Performance Model for Tensor Product Factorization in High-Order FEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06886v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate performance prediction is essential for optimizing scientific applications on modern high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ReinFog: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Empowered Framework for Resource Management in Edge and Cloud Computing Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13121v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing IoT landscape requires effective server deployment strategies to meet demands including real-time processing and energy efficiency. This is complicated by heterogeneous, dynamic applications and servers. To address these challenges, we propose ReinFog, a modular distributed software empowered with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adaptive resource management across edge/fog and cloud environments. ReinFog enables the practical development/deployment of various centralized and distributed DRL techniques for resource management in edge/fog and cloud computing environments. It also supports integrating native and library-based DRL techniques for diverse IoT application scheduling objectives. Additionally, ReinFog allows for customizing deployment configurations for different DRL techniques, including the number and placement of DRL Learners and DRL Workers in large-scale distributed systems. Besides, we propose a novel Memetic Algorithm for DRL Component (e.g., DRL Learners and DRL Workers) Placement in ReinFog named MADCP, which combines the strengths of Genetic Algorithm, Firefly Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. Experiments reveal that the DRL mechanisms developed within ReinFog have significantly enhanced both centralized and distributed DRL techniques implementation. These advancements have resulted in notable improvements in IoT application performance, reducing response time by 45%, energy consumption by 39%, and weighted cost by 37%, while maintaining minimal scheduling overhead. Additionally, ReinFog exhibits remarkable scalability, with a rise in DRL Workers from 1 to 30 causing only a 0.3-second increase in startup time and around 2 MB more RAM per Worker. The proposed MADCP for DRL component placement further accelerates the convergence rate of DRL techniques by up to 38%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FO-Complete Program Verification for Heap Logics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06719v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop the first two heap logics that have implicit heaplets and that admit FO-complete program verification. The notion of FO-completeness is a theoretical guarantee that all theorems that are valid when recursive definitions are interpreted as fixpoint definitions (instead of least fixpoint) are guaranteed to be eventually proven by the system. The logics we develop are a frame logic ($\textit{FL}$) and a separation logic ($\textit{SL-FL}$) that has an alternate semantics inspired by frame logic. We show verification condition generation for FL that is amenable to FO-complete reasoning using quantifier instantiation and SMT solvers. We show $\textit{SL-FL}$ can be translated to FL in order to obtain FO-complete reasoning. We implement tools that realize our technique and show the expressiveness of our logics and the efficacy of the verification technique on a suite of benchmarks that manipulate data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in OOPSLA '25</p></details> |
