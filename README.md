| **[Agentic Structured Graph Traversal for Root Cause Analysis of Code-related Incidents in Cloud Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22113v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions primarily address these challenges by incorporating wireless resource optimization strategies, often focusing on uplink resource allocation across clients under the assumption of homogeneous client-server network standards. However, these approaches overlooked the fact that mobile clients may connect to the server via diverse network standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) with customized configurations, limiting the flexibility of server-side modifications and restricting applicability in real-world commercial networks. This paper presents a novel theoretical analysis about how transmission failures in unreliable networks distort the effective label distributions of local samples, causing deviations from the global data distribution and introducing convergence bias in FL. Our analysis reveals that a carefully designed client selection strategy can mitigate biases induced by network unreliability and data heterogeneity. Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client selection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without relying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable networks with frequent transmission failures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communication-Efficient and Differentially Private Vertical Federated Learning with Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20565v3)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative model training across feature-partitioned devices, yet its reliance on device-server information exchange introduces significant communication overhead and privacy risks. Downlink communication from the server to devices in VFL exposes gradient-related signals of the global loss that can be leveraged in inference attacks. Existing privacy-preserving VFL approaches that inject differential privacy (DP) noise on the downlink have the natural repercussion of degraded gradient quality, slowed convergence, and excessive communication rounds. In this work, we propose DPZV, a communication-efficient and differentially private ZO-VFL framework with tunable privacy guarantees. Based on zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, DPZV injects calibrated scalar-valued DP noise on the downlink, significantly reducing variance amplification while providing equivalent protection against targeted inference attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish convergence guarantees comparable to first-order DP-SGD, despite relying solely on ZO estimators, and prove that DPZV satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPZV consistently achieves a superior privacy-utility tradeoff and requires fewer communication rounds than existing DP-VFL baselines under strict privacy constraints ($ε\leq 10$).</p></details> |  |
| **[Prefill vs. Decode Bottlenecks: SRAM-Frequency Tradeoffs and the Memory-Bandwidth Ceiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22066v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy consumption dictates the cost and environmental impact of deploying Large Language Models. This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.</p></details> |  |

Basic structures and both natural and contingent semantic operations are defined. Conversion rules are represented as a class of ternary relations with both group-like and category-like properties. A hierarchy of subclasses is explored, each satisfying stronger useful algebraic properties than the preceding, culminating in a direct efficient conversion-by-rewriting algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOG.io: Unified Rollback Recovery and Data Lineage Capture for Distributed Data Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16038v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LOG.io, a comprehensive solution designed for correct rollback recovery and fine-grain data lineage capture in distributed data pipelines. It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSCO: High-Performance Distributed Data Shuffling via Transformation-Communication Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22036v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models rely on \emph{expert parallelism} for efficient training and inference, which splits experts across devices and necessitates distributed data shuffling to route each token to its assigned experts. However, existing communication libraries handle this shuffling poorly; its overhead can account for over half of end-to-end runtime. We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Federated Fine-Tuning in Heterogeneous Networks with Unreliable Connections: An Aggregation View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22035v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLEST: Blazingly Efficient BFS using Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21967v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 3 algorithms, 46 references</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient and Personalized Federated Training of Generative Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11585v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ESCHER: Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation with Application to Triad Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21009v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21884v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIME:Accelerating Collaborative Lossless LLM Inference on Memory-Constrained Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21835v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating substantial impact across a wide range of domains and applications. However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Smart IoT-Based Leak Forecasting and Detection for Energy-Efficient Liquid Cooling in AI Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21801v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IEEE conference format</p></details> |
| **[Hyperion: Low-Latency Ultra-HD Video Analytics via Collaborative Vision Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21730v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in array-camera videography enable real-time capturing of ultra-high-definition (Ultra-HD) videos, providing rich visual information in a large field of view. However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[LEFT-RS: A Lock-Free Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing Protocol for Multicore Real-Time Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21701v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging real-time applications have driven the transition to multicore embedded systems, where tasks must share resources due to functional demands and limited availability. These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Trade-offs: A Unified Framework for Privacy, Robustness, and Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12978v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework designed to jointly provide differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and communication efficiency. Central to our approach is the concept of robust-compatible compression, which allows reducing the bi-directional communication overhead without undermining the robustness of the aggregation. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, which integrates the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)-based compression mechanism with robust averaging for robustness. Our theoretical analysis establishes the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging, ensuring that RobAJoL maintains robustness guarantees, satisfies DP, and substantially reduces communication overhead. We further present simulation results on CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and FEMNIST, validating our theoretical claims. We compare RobAJoL with a state-of-the-art communication-efficient and robust FL scheme augmented with DP for a fair comparison, demonstrating that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of "Fed-DPRoC: Communication-Efficient Differentially Private and Robust Federated Learning", presented at the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08846v4)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science, until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Embedding Samples Dispatching for Recommendation Model Training in Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21615v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on edge workers brings several benefits, particularly in terms of data privacy protection, low latency and personalization. However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an English version of Samples Dispatching Mechanism for Accelerating Recommendation Model Training in Edge Intelligent Computing System published in 2025 in the Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents.

Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client selection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without relying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable networks with frequent transmission failures.</p></details> |  |

Downlink communication from the server to devices in VFL exposes gradient-related signals of the global loss that can be leveraged in inference attacks. Existing privacy-preserving VFL approaches that inject differential privacy (DP) noise on the downlink have the natural repercussion of degraded gradient quality, slowed convergence, and excessive communication rounds. In this work, we propose DPZV, a communication-efficient and differentially private ZO-VFL framework with tunable privacy guarantees. Based on zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, DPZV injects calibrated scalar-valued DP noise on the downlink, significantly reducing variance amplification while providing equivalent protection against targeted inference attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish convergence guarantees comparable to first-order DP-SGD, despite relying solely on ZO estimators, and prove that DPZV satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPZV consistently achieves a superior privacy-utility tradeoff and requires fewer communication rounds than existing DP-VFL baselines under strict privacy constraints ($ε\leq 10$).</p></details> |  |

Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.</p></details> |  |

It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUSCO: High-Performance Distributed Data Shuffling via Transformation-Communication Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22036v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models rely on \emph{expert parallelism} for efficient training and inference, which splits experts across devices and necessitates distributed data shuffling to route each token to its assigned experts. However, existing communication libraries handle this shuffling poorly; its overhead can account for over half of end-to-end runtime. We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Federated Fine-Tuning in Heterogeneous Networks with Unreliable Connections: An Aggregation View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22035v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLEST: Blazingly Efficient BFS using Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21967v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 3 algorithms, 46 references</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient and Personalized Federated Training of Generative Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11585v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ESCHER: Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation with Application to Triad Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21009v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21884v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.</p></details> |  |

However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IEEE conference format</p></details> |

However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS 2025)</p></details> |

We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, which integrates the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)-based compression mechanism with robust averaging for robustness. Our theoretical analysis establishes the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging, ensuring that RobAJoL maintains robustness guarantees, satisfies DP, and substantially reduces communication overhead. We further present simulation results on CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and FEMNIST, validating our theoretical claims.

At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an English version of Samples Dispatching Mechanism for Accelerating Recommendation Model Training in Edge Intelligent Computing System published in 2025 in the Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |

Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration-caused cloud incidents. PRAXIS employs an LLM-driven structured traversal over two types of graph: (1) a service dependency graph (SDG) that captures microservice-level dependencies; and (2) a hammock-block program dependence graph (PDG) that captures code-level dependencies for each microservice. Together, these graphs encode microservice- and code-level dependencies and the LLM acts as a traversal policy over these graphs, moving between services and code dependencies to localize and explain failures. Compared to state-of-the-art ReAct baselines, PRAXIS improves RCA accuracy by up to 3.1x while reducing token consumption by 3.8x. PRAXIS is demonstrated on a set of 30 comprehensive real-world incidents that is being compiled into an RCA benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Federated Learning in Unreliable Wireless Networks: A Client Selection Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17260v4)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm for training deep neural networks (DNNs) at the wireless edge, but its performance can be severely hindered by unreliable wireless transmission and inherent data heterogeneity among clients. Existing solutions primarily address these challenges by incorporating wireless resource optimization strategies, often focusing on uplink resource allocation across clients under the assumption of homogeneous client-server network standards. However, these approaches overlooked the fact that mobile clients may connect to the server via diverse network standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) with customized configurations, limiting the flexibility of server-side modifications and restricting applicability in real-world commercial networks. This paper presents a novel theoretical analysis about how transmission failures in unreliable networks distort the effective label distributions of local samples, causing deviations from the global data distribution and introducing convergence bias in FL. Our analysis reveals that a carefully designed client selection strategy can mitigate biases induced by network unreliability and data heterogeneity. Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client selection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without relying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable networks with frequent transmission failures.</p></details> |  |

Downlink communication from the server to devices in VFL exposes gradient-related signals of the global loss that can be leveraged in inference attacks. Existing privacy-preserving VFL approaches that inject differential privacy (DP) noise on the downlink have the natural repercussion of degraded gradient quality, slowed convergence, and excessive communication rounds. In this work, we propose DPZV, a communication-efficient and differentially private ZO-VFL framework with tunable privacy guarantees. Based on zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, DPZV injects calibrated scalar-valued DP noise on the downlink, significantly reducing variance amplification while providing equivalent protection against targeted inference attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish convergence guarantees comparable to first-order DP-SGD, despite relying solely on ZO estimators, and prove that DPZV satisfies $(ε, δ)$-DP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPZV consistently achieves a superior privacy-utility tradeoff and requires fewer communication rounds than existing DP-VFL baselines under strict privacy constraints ($ε\leq 10$).</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the impact of on-chip SRAM size and operating frequency on the energy efficiency and performance of LLM inference, focusing on the distinct behaviors of the compute-bound prefill and memory-bound decode phases. Our simulation methodology combines OpenRAM for energy modeling, LLMCompass for latency simulation, and ScaleSIM for systolic array operational intensity. Our findings show that total energy use is predominantly determined by SRAM size in both phases, with larger buffers significantly increasing static energy due to leakage, which is not offset by corresponding latency benefits. We quantitatively explore the memory-bandwidth bottleneck, demonstrating that while high operating frequencies reduce prefill latency, their positive impact on memory-bound decode latency is capped by the external memory bandwidth. Counter-intuitively, high compute frequency can reduce total energy by reducing execution time and consequently decreasing static energy consumption more than the resulting dynamic power increase. We identify an optimal hardware configuration for the simulated workload: high operating frequencies (1200MHz-1400MHz) and a small local buffer size of 32KB to 64KB. This combination achieves the best energy-delay product, balancing low latency with high energy efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how memory bandwidth acts as a performance ceiling, and that increasing compute frequency only yields performance gains up to the point where the workload becomes memory-bound. This analysis provides concrete architectural insights for designing energy-efficient LLM accelerators, especially for datacenters aiming to minimize their energy overhead.</p></details> |  |

We present FUSCO, an MoE-friendly communication library that achieves efficient and lightweight data shuffling through fused data transformation and communication, based on the key observation that MoE's expert-major data layout conflicts with the device-major layout expected by communication operations. FUSCO captures the fine-grained data layout, which is then interpreted by a pipelined communication engine that performs the required shuffling efficiently along the communication path. Lightweight planning and load-balancing mechanisms complement the engine by eliminating redundant communication and dispersing traffic. Evaluations on representative benchmarks illustrate that FUSCO achieves up to 3.84$\times$ and 2.01$\times$ speedups over NCCL and DeepEP (the state-of-the-art MoE communication library), respectively. In end-to-end MoE tasks, compared to NCCL and DeepEP, FUSCO reduces the training latency by 1.17-1.39$\times$ and 1.10-1.19$\times$, and lowers the first-token generation latency in inference by 1.09-1.25$\times$ and 1.06-1.16$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Federated Fine-Tuning in Heterogeneous Networks with Unreliable Connections: An Aggregation View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22035v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) has attracted growing interest as it leverages both server- and client-side data to enhance global model generalization while preserving privacy, and significantly reduces the computational burden on edge devices by avoiding training from scratch. Despite these advantages, FFT performance is often degraded by unreliable server-client connections and heterogeneous client data distributions. Most existing methods assume homogeneous network conditions or require prior knowledge of connection failures. However, these assumptions are impractical in real-world networks characterized by diverse communication standards (e.g., wired, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G) and heterogeneous failure patterns. To address these limitations, we propose FedAuto, a novel FFT framework that mitigates the combined effects of connection failures and data heterogeneity via adaptive aggregation. FedAuto operates without prior knowledge of network conditions or modifications to existing infrastructure, enabling seamless plug-and-play deployment. Moreover, we establish a rigorous convergence guarantee for FedAuto. By adopting a novel per-round aggregation perspective, our analysis removes the need for assumptions on connection failures probabilities or client selection strategies commonly imposed in prior work, and guarantees convergence of FedAuto for each individual realization, providing a stronger theoretical assurance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedAuto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under diverse connection failure scenarios for both full-parameter and partial-parameter fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), and even surpasses strategies that rely on complex communication resource optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[BLEST: Blazingly Efficient BFS using Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21967v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph kernel that underpins a wide range of applications. While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 3 algorithms, 46 references</p></details> |
| **[Parameter-Efficient and Personalized Federated Training of Generative Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11585v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ESCHER: Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation with Application to Triad Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21009v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships in large complex networks are often modeled as hypergraphs. Analyzing hypergraph properties such as triad counts is essential, as hypergraphs can reveal intricate group interaction patterns that conventional graphs fail to capture. In real-world scenarios, these networks are often large and dynamic, introducing significant computational challenges. Due to the absence of specialized software packages and data structures, the analysis of large dynamic hypergraphs remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, we propose ESCHER, a GPU-centric parallel data structure for Efficient and Scalable Hypergraph Evolution Representation, designed to manage large scale hypergraph dynamics efficiently. We also design a hypergraph triad-count update framework that minimizes redundant computation while fully leveraging the capabilities of ESCHER for dynamic operations. We validate the efficacy of our approach across multiple categories of hypergraph triad counting, including hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triads. Empirical results on both large real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving speedups of up to 104.5x, 473.7x, and 112.5x for hyperedge-based, incident-vertex-based, and temporal triad types, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Resource Allocation for Geographically-Distributed Inference by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21884v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in many AI tasks but are expensive to use, even after training, due to their requirement of high-end GPUs. Recently, a distributed system called PETALS was developed to lower the barrier for deploying LLMs by splitting the model blocks across multiple servers with low-end GPUs distributed over the Internet, which was much faster than swapping the model parameters between the GPU memory and other cheaper but slower local storage media. However, the performance of such a distributed system critically depends on the resource allocation, and how to do so optimally remains unknown. In this work, we present the first systematic study of the resource allocation problem in distributed LLM inference, with focus on two important decisions: block placement and request routing. Our main results include: experimentally validated performance models that can predict the inference performance under given block placement and request routing decisions, a formulation of the offline optimization of block placement and request routing as a mixed integer linear programming problem together with the NP-hardness proof and a polynomial-complexity algorithm with guaranteed performance, and an adaptation of the offline algorithm for the online setting with the same performance guarantee under bounded load. Through both experiments and experimentally-validated simulations, we have verified that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the inference time compared to the state-of-the-art solution in diverse settings with geographically-distributed servers. As a byproduct, we have also developed a light-weighted CPU-only simulator capable of predicting the performance of distributed LLM inference on GPU servers, which can evaluate large deployments and facilitate future research for researchers with limited GPU access.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIME:Accelerating Collaborative Lossless LLM Inference on Memory-Constrained Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21835v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for intelligent reasoning and decision-making, demonstrating substantial impact across a wide range of domains and applications. However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Smart IoT-Based Leak Forecasting and Detection for Energy-Efficient Liquid Cooling in AI Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21801v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IEEE conference format</p></details> |

However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[LEFT-RS: A Lock-Free Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing Protocol for Multicore Real-Time Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21701v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging real-time applications have driven the transition to multicore embedded systems, where tasks must share resources due to functional demands and limited availability. These resources, whether local or global, are protected within critical sections to prevent race conditions, with locking protocols ensuring both exclusive access and timing requirements. However, transient faults occurring within critical sections can disrupt execution and propagate errors across multiple tasks. Conventional locking protocols fail to address such faults, and integrating traditional fault tolerance techniques often increases blocking. Recent approaches improve fault recovery through parallel replica execution; however, challenges remain due to sequential accessing, coordination overhead, and susceptibility to common-mode faults. In this paper, we propose a Lock-frEe Fault-Tolerant Resource Sharing (LEFT-RS) protocol for multicore real-time systems. LEFT-RS allows tasks to concurrently access and read global resources while entering their critical sections in parallel. Each task can complete its access earlier upon successful execution if other tasks experience faults, thereby improving the efficiency of resource usage. Our design also limits the overhead and enhances fault resilience. We present a comprehensive worst-case response time analysis to ensure timing guarantees. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to an 84.5% improvement in schedulability on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS 2025)</p></details> |

Central to our approach is the concept of robust-compatible compression, which allows reducing the bi-directional communication overhead without undermining the robustness of the aggregation. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, which integrates the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)-based compression mechanism with robust averaging for robustness. Our theoretical analysis establishes the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging, ensuring that RobAJoL maintains robustness guarantees, satisfies DP, and substantially reduces communication overhead. We further present simulation results on CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and FEMNIST, validating our theoretical claims. We compare RobAJoL with a state-of-the-art communication-efficient and robust FL scheme augmented with DP for a fair comparison, demonstrating that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of "Fed-DPRoC: Communication-Efficient Differentially Private and Robust Federated Learning", presented at the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08846v4)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science, until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Embedding Samples Dispatching for Recommendation Model Training in Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21615v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) on edge workers brings several benefits, particularly in terms of data privacy protection, low latency and personalization. However, due to the huge size of embedding tables, typical DLRM training frameworks adopt one or more parameter servers to maintain global embedding tables, while leveraging the edge workers cache part of them. This incurs significant transmission cost for embedding transmissions between workers and parameter servers, which can dominate the training cycle. In this paper, we investigate how to dispatch input embedding samples to appropriate edge workers to minimize the total embedding transmission cost when facing edge-specific challenges such as heterogeneous networks and limited resources. We develop ESD, a novel mechanism that optimizes the dispatch of input embedding samples to edge workers based on expected embedding transmission cost. We propose HybridDis as the dispatch decision method within ESD, which combines a resource-intensive optimal algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to balance decision quality and resource consumption. We implement a prototype of ESD and compare it with state-of-the-art mechanisms on real-world workloads. Extensive experimental results show that ESD reduces the embedding transmission cost by up to 36.76% and achieves up to 1.74 times speedup in end-to-end DLRM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an English version of Samples Dispatching Mechanism for Accelerating Recommendation Model Training in Edge Intelligent Computing System published in 2025 in the Journal of Computer Research and Development</p></details> |
