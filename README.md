Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of traditional optimization methods that ignore energy constraints. This work presents EARL, an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with an adaptive reinforcement learning based selection policy to jointly optimize accuracy and energy consumption. EARL employs surrogate modeling for global exploration, reinforcement learning for dynamic candidate prioritization, and an early termination mechanism to eliminate redundant evaluations, substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EARL achieves 6 to 15 percent higher accuracy, 60 to 80 percent lower energy consumption, and up to an order of magnitude reduction in optimization time compared to leading hyperparameter tuning frameworks. These results highlight the effectiveness of energy-aware adaptive search in improving the efficiency and scalability of LSMs for resource-constrained on-device AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 2 Tables, conference [Submitted in PerConAI-2026]</p></details> |
| **[Nalar: An agent serving framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05109v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-driven agentic applications increasingly automate complex, multi-step tasks, but serving them efficiently remains challenging due to heterogeneous components, dynamic and model-driven control flow, long-running state, and unpredictable latencies. Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\%, achieves up to $2.9\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Squirrel Parser: A Linear-Time PEG Packrat Parser Capable of Left Recursion and Optimal Error Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05012v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the squirrel parser, a PEG packrat parser that directly handles all forms of left recursion with optimal error recovery, while maintaining linear time complexity in the length of the input even in the presence of an arbitrary number of errors. Traditional approaches to handling left recursion in a recursive descent parser require grammar rewriting or complex algorithmic extensions. We derive a minimal algorithm from first principles: cycle detection via per-position state tracking and $O(1)$-per-LR-cycle communication from descendant to ancestor recursion frames, and fixed-point search via iterative expansion. For error recovery, we derived a set of four axioms and twelve constraints that must be imposed upon an optimal error recovery design to ensure completeness, correctness, optimality of performance, and intuitiveness of behavior. We utilized a constraint satisfaction mechanism to search the space of all possibilities, arriving at a provably optimal and robust error recovery strategy that maintains perfect performance linearity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Secure Federated Learning with Byzantine aggregators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04930v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving federated averaging is a central approach for protecting client privacy in federated learning. In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Quadratic Selected Inversion in Quantum Transport Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04904v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by Moore's Law, the dimensions of transistors have been pushed down to the nanometer scale. Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Proof of Commitment: A Human-Centric Resource for Permissionless Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04813v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Permissionless consensus protocols require a scarce resource to regulate leader election and provide Sybil resistance. Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable. We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window. Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony. Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Evaluation of the Potential of Carbon-Aware Execution for Scientific Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14625v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific workflows are widely used to automate scientific data analysis and often involve computationally intensive processing of large datasets on compute clusters. As such, their execution tends to be long-running and resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant, efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by 67%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a pre-print of our paper currently under review</p></details> |
| **[FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10367v4)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

| **[GPU-Accelerated INT8 Quantization for KV Cache Compression in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04719v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior</p></details> |  |
| **[MQ-GNN: A Multi-Queue Pipelined Architecture for Scalable and Efficient GNN Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04707v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.</p></details> | IEEE Access 2025 |
| **[Predictive Monitoring against Pattern Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14611v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the problem of dynamically analysing concurrent software against high-level temporal specifications. Existing techniques for runtime monitoring against such specifications are primarily designed for sequential software and remain inadequate in the presence of concurrency -- violations may be observed only in intricate thread interleavings, requiring many re-runs of the underlying software. Towards this, we study the problem of predictive runtime monitoring, inspired by the analogous problem of predictive data race detection studied extensively recently. The predictive runtime monitoring question asks, given an execution $σ$, if it can be soundly reordered to expose violations of a specification. In this paper, we focus on specifications that are given in regular languages. Our notion of reorderings is trace equivalence, where an execution is considered a reordering of another if it can be obtained from the latter by successively commuting adjacent independent actions. We first show that the problem of predictive admits a super-linear lower bound of $O(n^α)$, where $n$ is the number of events in the execution, and $α$ is a parameter describing the degree of commutativity. As a result, predictive runtime monitoring even in this setting is unlikely to be efficiently solvable. Towards this, we identify a sub-class of regular languages, called pattern languages (and their extension generalized pattern languages). Pattern languages can naturally express specific ordering of some number of (labelled) events, and have been inspired by popular empirical hypotheses, the `small bug depth' hypothesis. More importantly, we show that for pattern (and generalized pattern) languages, the predictive monitoring problem can be solved using a constant-space streaming linear-time algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of Theorem 3.2 has been revised.

| **[Quantifying Autoscaler Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study of Resource Misallocation Induced by Cloud Infrastructure Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04659v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource autoscaling mechanisms in cloud environments depend on accurate performance metrics to make optimal provisioning decisions. When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanism Design for Federated Learning with Non-Monotonic Network Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04648v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of Mobihoc conference version, under review of IEEE TMC</p></details> |
| **[APoW: Auditable Proof-of-Work Against Block Withholding Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02496v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Auditable Proof-of-Work (APoW), a novel proof-of-work (PoW) construction inspired by Hashcash-style nonce searching, which enables the auditing of other miners' work through accountable re-scanning of the nonce space. The proposed scheme allows a miner to probabilistically attest to having searched specified regions of the nonce space in earlier mining rounds, while concurrently earning rewards for performing productive work for a new block or pool share. This capability enables miners belonging to a mining pools to audit another miner's claimed effort retroactively, thereby allowing the probabilistic detection of block withholding attacks (BWAs) without requiring trusted hardware or trusted third parties. As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining. Finally, while a full deployment of APoW in Bitcoin would require a consensus rule change and minor modifications to mining ASICs, the construction remains practically useful even without consensus changes, for instance, as a pool-level auditing mechanism that enables verifiable pay-for-auditing using existing pool reserves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lenses for Partially-Specified States (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04573v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A bidirectional transformation is a pair of transformations satisfying certain well-behavedness properties: one maps source data into view data, and the other translates changes on the view back to the source. However, when multiple views share a source, an update on one view may affect the others, making it hard to maintain correspondence while preserving the user's update, especially when multiple views are changed at once. Ensuring these properties within a compositional framework is even more challenging. In this paper, we propose partial-state lenses, which allow source and view states to be partially specified to precisely represent the user's update intentions. These intentions are partially ordered, providing clear semantics for merging intentions of updates coming from multiple views and a refined notion of update preservation compatible with this merging. We formalize partial-state lenses, together with partial-specifiedness-aware well-behavedness that supports compositional reasoning and ensures update preservation. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed system through examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our paper to appear in ESOP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Model-Based Design of Human Centric AI enabled CPS for Long term usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04545v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeliness-Oriented Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Multi-Region Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04542v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Convergence of Sign-based Random Reshuffling Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15976v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>signSGD is popular in nonconvex optimization due to its communication efficiency. Yet, existing analyses typically assume data are sampled with replacement in each iteration, contradicting a common practical implementation where data are randomly reshuffled and sequentially fed into the algorithm. This gap leaves the theoretical understanding of the more practical algorithm, signSGD with random reshuffling (SignRR), largely unexplored. We develop the first analysis of SignRR to identify the core technical challenge that prevents a thorough convergence analysis of this method. In particular, given a dataset of size $n$ and $T$ epochs, we show that the expected gradient norm of SignRR is upper bounded by $O(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} + σ)$, where $σ$ is the averaged conditional mean square error that may not vanish. To tackle this limitation, we develop two new sign-based algorithms under random reshuffling: SignRVR, which incorporates variance-reduced gradients, and SignRVM, which integrates momentum-based updates. Both algorithms achieve a faster convergence rate of ${O}(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} +\log(nT)\sqrt{n}/\sqrt{T})$. We further extend our algorithms to a distributed setting, with a convergence rate of ${O}(\log(n_0T)/\sqrt{n_0T} +\log (n_0T)\sqrt{n_0}/\sqrt{T})$, where $n_0$ is the size of the dataset of a single machine. These results mark the first step towards the theoretical understanding of practical implementation of sign-based optimization algorithms. Finally, we back up our theoretical findings through experiments on simulated and real-world problems, verifying that randomly reshuffled sign methods match or surpass existing baselines.</p></details> | 37 pages, 5 figures |

In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.</p></details> |  |

Advanced quantum transport (QT) solvers are required to accurately simulate such nano-devices. The non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism lends itself optimally to these tasks, but it is computationally very intensive, involving the selected inversion (SI) of matrices and the selected solution of quadratic matrix (SQ) equations. Existing algorithms to tackle these numerical problems are ideally suited to GPU acceleration, e.g., the so-called recursive Green's function (RGF) technique, but they are typically sequential, require block-tridiagonal (BT) matrices as inputs, and their implementation has been so far restricted to shared memory parallelism, thus limiting the achievable device sizes. To address these shortcomings, we introduce distributed methods that build on RGF and enable parallel selected inversion and selected solution of the quadratic matrix equation. We further extend them to handle BT matrices with arrowhead, which allows for the investigation of multi-terminal transistor structures. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a real dataset from the QT simulation of a nano-ribbon transistor and compare it with the sparse direct package PARDISO. When scaling to 16 GPUs, our fused SI and SQ solver is 5.2x faster than the SI module of PARDISO applied to a device 16x shorter. These results highlight the potential of our method to accelerate NEGF-based nano-device simulations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Existing paradigms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake instantiate this scarcity through parallelizable resources like computation or capital. Once acquired, these resources can be subdivided across many identities at negligible marginal cost, making linear Sybil cost fundamentally unattainable. We introduce Proof of Commitment (PoCmt), a consensus primitive grounded in a non-parallelizable resource: real-time human engagement. Validators maintain a commitment state capturing cumulative human effort, protocol participation, and online availability. Engagement is enforced through a Human Challenge Oracle that issues identity-bound, time-sensitive challenges, limiting the number of challenges solvable within each human window. Under this model, sustaining multiple active identities requires proportional human-time effort. We establish a cost-theoretic separation showing that protocols based on parallelizable resources admit zero marginal Sybil cost, whereas PoCmt enforces a strictly linear cost profile. Using a weighted-backbone analysis, we show that PoCmt achieves safety, liveness, and commitment-proportional fairness under partial synchrony. Simulations complement the analysis by isolating human-time capacity as the sole adversarial bottleneck and validating the predicted commitment drift and fairness properties. These results position PoCmt as a new point in the consensus design space, grounding permissionless security in sustained human effort rather than computation or capital.</p></details> |  |

As such, their execution tends to be long-running and resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant, efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by 67%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a pre-print of our paper currently under review</p></details> |

However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior</p></details> |  |

Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.</p></details> | IEEE Access 2025 |
| **[Predictive Monitoring against Pattern Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14611v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the problem of dynamically analysing concurrent software against high-level temporal specifications. Existing techniques for runtime monitoring against such specifications are primarily designed for sequential software and remain inadequate in the presence of concurrency -- violations may be observed only in intricate thread interleavings, requiring many re-runs of the underlying software. Towards this, we study the problem of predictive runtime monitoring, inspired by the analogous problem of predictive data race detection studied extensively recently. The predictive runtime monitoring question asks, given an execution $σ$, if it can be soundly reordered to expose violations of a specification. In this paper, we focus on specifications that are given in regular languages. Our notion of reorderings is trace equivalence, where an execution is considered a reordering of another if it can be obtained from the latter by successively commuting adjacent independent actions. We first show that the problem of predictive admits a super-linear lower bound of $O(n^α)$, where $n$ is the number of events in the execution, and $α$ is a parameter describing the degree of commutativity. As a result, predictive runtime monitoring even in this setting is unlikely to be efficiently solvable. Towards this, we identify a sub-class of regular languages, called pattern languages (and their extension generalized pattern languages). Pattern languages can naturally express specific ordering of some number of (labelled) events, and have been inspired by popular empirical hypotheses, the `small bug depth' hypothesis. More importantly, we show that for pattern (and generalized pattern) languages, the predictive monitoring problem can be solved using a constant-space streaming linear-time algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of Theorem 3.2 has been revised.

When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanism Design for Federated Learning with Non-Monotonic Network Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04648v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of Mobihoc conference version, under review of IEEE TMC</p></details> |

The proposed scheme allows a miner to probabilistically attest to having searched specified regions of the nonce space in earlier mining rounds, while concurrently earning rewards for performing productive work for a new block or pool share. This capability enables miners belonging to a mining pools to audit another miner's claimed effort retroactively, thereby allowing the probabilistic detection of block withholding attacks (BWAs) without requiring trusted hardware or trusted third parties. As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining. Finally, while a full deployment of APoW in Bitcoin would require a consensus rule change and minor modifications to mining ASICs, the construction remains practically useful even without consensus changes, for instance, as a pool-level auditing mechanism that enables verifiable pay-for-auditing using existing pool reserves.</p></details> |  |

However, when multiple views share a source, an update on one view may affect the others, making it hard to maintain correspondence while preserving the user's update, especially when multiple views are changed at once. Ensuring these properties within a compositional framework is even more challenging. In this paper, we propose partial-state lenses, which allow source and view states to be partially specified to precisely represent the user's update intentions. These intentions are partially ordered, providing clear semantics for merging intentions of updates coming from multiple views and a refined notion of update preservation compatible with this merging. We formalize partial-state lenses, together with partial-specifiedness-aware well-behavedness that supports compositional reasoning and ensures update preservation. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed system through examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our paper to appear in ESOP 2026</p></details> |

Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.</p></details> |  |

It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Yet, existing analyses typically assume data are sampled with replacement in each iteration, contradicting a common practical implementation where data are randomly reshuffled and sequentially fed into the algorithm. This gap leaves the theoretical understanding of the more practical algorithm, signSGD with random reshuffling (SignRR), largely unexplored. We develop the first analysis of SignRR to identify the core technical challenge that prevents a thorough convergence analysis of this method. In particular, given a dataset of size $n$ and $T$ epochs, we show that the expected gradient norm of SignRR is upper bounded by $O(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} + σ)$, where $σ$ is the averaged conditional mean square error that may not vanish. To tackle this limitation, we develop two new sign-based algorithms under random reshuffling: SignRVR, which incorporates variance-reduced gradients, and SignRVM, which integrates momentum-based updates. Both algorithms achieve a faster convergence rate of ${O}(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} +\log(nT)\sqrt{n}/\sqrt{T})$. We further extend our algorithms to a distributed setting, with a convergence rate of ${O}(\log(n_0T)/\sqrt{n_0T} +\log (n_0T)\sqrt{n_0}/\sqrt{T})$, where $n_0$ is the size of the dataset of a single machine. These results mark the first step towards the theoretical understanding of practical implementation of sign-based optimization algorithms. Finally, we back up our theoretical findings through experiments on simulated and real-world problems, verifying that randomly reshuffled sign methods match or surpass existing baselines.</p></details> | 37 pages, 5 figures |

Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of traditional optimization methods that ignore energy constraints. This work presents EARL, an energy-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates Bayesian optimization with an adaptive reinforcement learning based selection policy to jointly optimize accuracy and energy consumption. EARL employs surrogate modeling for global exploration, reinforcement learning for dynamic candidate prioritization, and an early termination mechanism to eliminate redundant evaluations, substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EARL achieves 6 to 15 percent higher accuracy, 60 to 80 percent lower energy consumption, and up to an order of magnitude reduction in optimization time compared to leading hyperparameter tuning frameworks. These results highlight the effectiveness of energy-aware adaptive search in improving the efficiency and scalability of LSMs for resource-constrained on-device AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 2 Tables, conference [Submitted in PerConAI-2026]</p></details> |

Nalar is a ground-up agent-serving framework that cleanly separates workflow specification from execution while providing the runtime visibility and control needed for robust performance. Nalar preserves full Python expressiveness, using lightweight auto-generated stubs that turn agent and tool invocations into futures carrying dependency and context metadata. A managed state layer decouples logical state from physical placement, enabling safe reuse, migration, and consistent retry behavior. A two-level control architecture combines global policy computation with local event-driven enforcement to support adaptive routing, scheduling, and resource management across evolving workflows. Together, these mechanisms allow Nalar to deliver scalable, efficient, and policy-driven serving of heterogeneous agentic applications without burdening developers with orchestration logic. Across three agentic workloads, Nalar cuts tail latency by 34--74\%, achieves up to $2.9\times$ speedups, sustains 80 RPS where baselines fail, and scales to 130K futures with sub-500 ms control overhead.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to handling left recursion in a recursive descent parser require grammar rewriting or complex algorithmic extensions. We derive a minimal algorithm from first principles: cycle detection via per-position state tracking and $O(1)$-per-LR-cycle communication from descendant to ancestor recursion frames, and fixed-point search via iterative expansion. For error recovery, we derived a set of four axioms and twelve constraints that must be imposed upon an optimal error recovery design to ensure completeness, correctness, optimality of performance, and intuitiveness of behavior. We utilized a constraint satisfaction mechanism to search the space of all possibilities, arriving at a provably optimal and robust error recovery strategy that maintains perfect performance linearity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this problem in an asynchronous communications setting with malicious aggregators. We propose a new solution to provide federated averaging in this model while protecting the client's data privacy through secure aggregation and differential privacy. Our solution maintains the same performance as the state of the art across all metrics. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, unlike existing single- or multi-server solutions, we consider malicious aggregation servers that may manipulate the model to leak clients' data or halt computation. To tolerate this threat, we replicate the aggregators, allowing a fraction of them to be corrupted. Second, we propose a new privacy preservation protocol for protocols in asynchronous communication models with Byzantine aggregators. In this protocol, clients mask their values and add Gaussian noise to their models. In contrast with previous works, we use the replicated servers to unmask the models, while ensuring the liveness of training even if aggregators misbehave. Third, the asynchronous communication model introduces new challenges not present in existing approaches. In such a setting, faster clients may contribute more frequently, potentially reducing their privacy and biasing the training. To address this, we introduce an inclusion mechanism that ensures uniform client participation and balanced privacy budgets. Interestingly, the solution presented in this paper does not rely on agreement between aggregators. Thus, we circumvent the known impossibility of consensus in asynchronous settings where processes might crash. Additionally, this feature increases availability, as a consensus-based algorithm only progresses in periods of low latency.</p></details> |  |

However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

| **[GPU-Accelerated INT8 Quantization for KV Cache Compression in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04719v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key-value (KV) cache in large language models presents a significant memory bottleneck during inference, growing linearly with sequence length and often exceeding the memory footprint of model weights themselves. We implement and evaluate GPU-accelerated INT8 quantization for KV cache compression, achieving 4$\times$ memory reduction with minimal accuracy degradation. We develop four CUDA kernel variants -- naive, tiled, coarsened, and vectorized -- and benchmark them across realistic workload sizes up to 1 billion elements. Our vectorized kernel achieves up to 1,694$\times$ speedup over CPU baselines while maintaining reconstruction error below 0.004 and attention score error below 0.1 even for 8K-dimensional heads. These results demonstrate that INT8 quantization provides a practical approach for reducing memory pressure in LLM inference with negligible computational overhead (6--58ms) and minimal impact on downstream model behavior</p></details> |  |
| **[MQ-GNN: A Multi-Queue Pipelined Architecture for Scalable and Efficient GNN Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04707v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning graph-structured data, but their scalability is hindered by inefficient mini-batch generation, data transfer bottlenecks, and costly inter-GPU synchronization. Existing training frameworks fail to overlap these stages, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. This paper proposes MQ-GNN, a multi-queue pipelined framework that maximizes training efficiency by interleaving GNN training stages and optimizing resource utilization. MQ-GNN introduces Ready-to-Update Asynchronous Consistent Model (RaCoM), which enables asynchronous gradient sharing and model updates while ensuring global consistency through adaptive periodic synchronization. Additionally, it employs global neighbor sampling with caching to reduce data transfer overhead and an adaptive queue-sizing strategy to balance computation and memory efficiency. Experiments on four large-scale datasets and ten baseline models demonstrate that MQ-GNN achieves up to \boldmath $\bm{4.6\,\times}$ faster training time and 30% improved GPU utilization while maintaining competitive accuracy. These results establish MQ-GNN as a scalable and efficient solution for multi-GPU GNN training.</p></details> | IEEE Access 2025 |
| **[Predictive Monitoring against Pattern Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14611v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the problem of dynamically analysing concurrent software against high-level temporal specifications. Existing techniques for runtime monitoring against such specifications are primarily designed for sequential software and remain inadequate in the presence of concurrency -- violations may be observed only in intricate thread interleavings, requiring many re-runs of the underlying software. Towards this, we study the problem of predictive runtime monitoring, inspired by the analogous problem of predictive data race detection studied extensively recently. The predictive runtime monitoring question asks, given an execution $σ$, if it can be soundly reordered to expose violations of a specification. In this paper, we focus on specifications that are given in regular languages. Our notion of reorderings is trace equivalence, where an execution is considered a reordering of another if it can be obtained from the latter by successively commuting adjacent independent actions. We first show that the problem of predictive admits a super-linear lower bound of $O(n^α)$, where $n$ is the number of events in the execution, and $α$ is a parameter describing the degree of commutativity. As a result, predictive runtime monitoring even in this setting is unlikely to be efficiently solvable. Towards this, we identify a sub-class of regular languages, called pattern languages (and their extension generalized pattern languages). Pattern languages can naturally express specific ordering of some number of (labelled) events, and have been inspired by popular empirical hypotheses, the `small bug depth' hypothesis. More importantly, we show that for pattern (and generalized pattern) languages, the predictive monitoring problem can be solved using a constant-space streaming linear-time algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The proof of Theorem 3.2 has been revised.

| **[Quantifying Autoscaler Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study of Resource Misallocation Induced by Cloud Infrastructure Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04659v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource autoscaling mechanisms in cloud environments depend on accurate performance metrics to make optimal provisioning decisions. When infrastructure faults including hardware malfunctions, network disruptions, and software anomalies corrupt these metrics, autoscalers may systematically over- or under-provision resources, resulting in elevated operational expenses or degraded service reliability. This paper conducts controlled simulation experiments to measure how four prevalent fault categories affect both vertical and horizontal autoscaling behaviors across multiple instance configurations and service level objective (SLO) thresholds. Experimental findings demonstrate that storage-related faults generate the largest cost overhead, adding up to $258 monthly under horizontal scaling policies, whereas routing anomalies consistently bias autoscalers toward insufficient resource allocation. The sensitivity to fault-induced metric distortions differs markedly between scaling strategies: horizontal autoscaling exhibits greater susceptibility to transient anomalies, particularly near threshold boundaries. These empirically-grounded insights offer actionable recommendations for designing fault-tolerant autoscaling policies that distinguish genuine workload fluctuations from failure artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanism Design for Federated Learning with Non-Monotonic Network Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04648v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanism design is pivotal to federated learning (FL) for maximizing social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients. Existing mechanisms, however, often overlook the network effects of client participation and the diverse model performance requirements (i.e., generalization error) across applications, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare, or even inapplicability in real deployments. To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of Mobihoc conference version, under review of IEEE TMC</p></details> |
| **[APoW: Auditable Proof-of-Work Against Block Withholding Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02496v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Auditable Proof-of-Work (APoW), a novel proof-of-work (PoW) construction inspired by Hashcash-style nonce searching, which enables the auditing of other miners' work through accountable re-scanning of the nonce space. The proposed scheme allows a miner to probabilistically attest to having searched specified regions of the nonce space in earlier mining rounds, while concurrently earning rewards for performing productive work for a new block or pool share. This capability enables miners belonging to a mining pools to audit another miner's claimed effort retroactively, thereby allowing the probabilistic detection of block withholding attacks (BWAs) without requiring trusted hardware or trusted third parties. As a consequence, the construction supports the design of decentralized mining pools in which work attribution is verifiable and withholding incentives are substantially reduced. The scheme preserves the fundamental properties of conventional PoW, including public verifiability and difficulty adjustment, while adding an orthogonal auditability layer tailored to pool-based mining. Finally, while a full deployment of APoW in Bitcoin would require a consensus rule change and minor modifications to mining ASICs, the construction remains practically useful even without consensus changes, for instance, as a pool-level auditing mechanism that enables verifiable pay-for-auditing using existing pool reserves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lenses for Partially-Specified States (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04573v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A bidirectional transformation is a pair of transformations satisfying certain well-behavedness properties: one maps source data into view data, and the other translates changes on the view back to the source. However, when multiple views share a source, an update on one view may affect the others, making it hard to maintain correspondence while preserving the user's update, especially when multiple views are changed at once. Ensuring these properties within a compositional framework is even more challenging. In this paper, we propose partial-state lenses, which allow source and view states to be partially specified to precisely represent the user's update intentions. These intentions are partially ordered, providing clear semantics for merging intentions of updates coming from multiple views and a refined notion of update preservation compatible with this merging. We formalize partial-state lenses, together with partial-specifiedness-aware well-behavedness that supports compositional reasoning and ensures update preservation. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed system through examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our paper to appear in ESOP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Model-Based Design of Human Centric AI enabled CPS for Long term usage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04545v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human centric critical systems are increasingly involving artificial intelligence to enable knowledge extraction from sensor collected data. Examples include medical monitoring and control systems, gesture based human computer interaction systems, and autonomous cars. Such systems are intended to operate for a long term potentially for a lifetime in many scenarios such as closed loop blood glucose control for Type 1 diabetics, self-driving cars, and monitoting systems for stroke diagnosis, and rehabilitation. Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system. In this paper, we analyze the existing techniques for safety, sustainability, and security analysis of an AI enabled human centric control system and discuss their limitations for testing the system for long term use in practice. We then propose personalized model based solutions for potentially eliminating such limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeliness-Oriented Scheduling and Resource Allocation in Multi-Region Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04542v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception (CP) is a critical technology in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities. It involves the sharing and fusion of information among sensors to overcome the limitations of individual perception, such as blind spots and range limitations. However, CP faces two primary challenges. First, due to the dynamic nature of the environment, the timeliness of the transmitted information is critical to perception performance. Second, with limited computational power at the sensors and constrained wireless bandwidth, the communication volume must be carefully designed to ensure feature representations are both effective and sufficient. This work studies the dynamic scheduling problem in a multi-region CP scenario, and presents a Timeliness-Aware Multi-region Prioritized (TAMP) scheduling algorithm to trade-off perception accuracy and communication resource usage. Timeliness reflects the utility of information that decays as time elapses, which is manifested by the perception performance in CP tasks. We propose an empirical penalty function that maps the joint impact of Age of Information (AoI) and communication volume to perception performance. Aiming to minimize this timeliness-oriented penalty in the long-term, and recognizing that scheduling decisions have a cumulative effect on subsequent system states, we propose the TAMP scheduling algorithm. TAMP is a Lyapunov-based optimization policy that decomposes the long-term average objective into a per-slot prioritization problem, balancing the scheduling worth against resource cost. We validate our algorithm in both intersection and corridor scenarios with the real-world Roadside Cooperative perception (RCooper) dataset. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TAMP outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an Average Precision (AP) improvement of up to 27% across various configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Convergence of Sign-based Random Reshuffling Algorithms for Nonconvex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15976v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>signSGD is popular in nonconvex optimization due to its communication efficiency. Yet, existing analyses typically assume data are sampled with replacement in each iteration, contradicting a common practical implementation where data are randomly reshuffled and sequentially fed into the algorithm. This gap leaves the theoretical understanding of the more practical algorithm, signSGD with random reshuffling (SignRR), largely unexplored. We develop the first analysis of SignRR to identify the core technical challenge that prevents a thorough convergence analysis of this method. In particular, given a dataset of size $n$ and $T$ epochs, we show that the expected gradient norm of SignRR is upper bounded by $O(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} + σ)$, where $σ$ is the averaged conditional mean square error that may not vanish. To tackle this limitation, we develop two new sign-based algorithms under random reshuffling: SignRVR, which incorporates variance-reduced gradients, and SignRVM, which integrates momentum-based updates. Both algorithms achieve a faster convergence rate of ${O}(\log(nT)/\sqrt{nT} +\log(nT)\sqrt{n}/\sqrt{T})$. We further extend our algorithms to a distributed setting, with a convergence rate of ${O}(\log(n_0T)/\sqrt{n_0T} +\log (n_0T)\sqrt{n_0}/\sqrt{T})$, where $n_0$ is the size of the dataset of a single machine. These results mark the first step towards the theoretical understanding of practical implementation of sign-based optimization algorithms. Finally, we back up our theoretical findings through experiments on simulated and real-world problems, verifying that randomly reshuffled sign methods match or surpass existing baselines.</p></details> | 37 pages, 5 figures |
