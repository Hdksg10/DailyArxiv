| **[DSD: A Distributed Speculative Decoding Solution for Edge-Cloud Agile Large Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21669v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.</p></details> |  |

Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Test Driven Development with Large Language Models for Reliable and Verifiable Spreadsheet Code Generation: A Research Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15585v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner. The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high. We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest. We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining. MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the Effect of Data Redundancy on Speedup in MLFMA Near-Field Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21535v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Behavioural Conformances via Fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18509v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as \emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing GPU Energy Usage in Exascale-Ready Portable Science Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05623v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterize the GPU energy usage of two widely adopted exascale-ready applications representing two classes of particle and mesh solvers: (i) QMCPACK, a quantum Monte Carlo package, and (ii) AMReXCastro, an adaptive mesh astrophysical code. We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm_smi_lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also, we found gaps in the AMD tooling used on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms-1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

| **[MemFine: Memory-Aware Fine-Grained Scheduling for MoE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21431v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Dynamic AI Inference Scaling on HPC-Infrastructure: Integrating Kubernetes, Slurm and vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21413v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[QiMeng-CRUX: Narrowing the Gap between Natural Language and Verilog via Core Refined Understanding eXpression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20099v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/zy1xxx/SALV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs. However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures. Version accepted at APLAS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Handling of Memory Page Faults during Virtual-Address RDMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them. State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux. This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Master of Science (MSc) Thesis 2019.

| **[IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality. First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically. Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Bachelor of Science (BSc) Thesis 2017.

| **[A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</p></details> |  |

Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner. The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high. We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest. We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining. MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the Effect of Data Redundancy on Speedup in MLFMA Near-Field Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21535v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Behavioural Conformances via Fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18509v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as \emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.</p></details> |  |

We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm_smi_lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also, we found gaps in the AMD tooling used on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms-1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Dynamic AI Inference Scaling on HPC-Infrastructure: Integrating Kubernetes, Slurm and vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21413v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

| **[Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs. However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures. Version accepted at APLAS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Handling of Memory Page Faults during Virtual-Address RDMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them. State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux. This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Master of Science (MSc) Thesis 2019.

| **[IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality. First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically. Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Bachelor of Science (BSc) Thesis 2017.

| **[A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</p></details> |  |

Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.</p></details> |  |

Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.</p></details> |  |

Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner. The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high. We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest. We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining. MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the Effect of Data Redundancy on Speedup in MLFMA Near-Field Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21535v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SV-LIB 1.0: A Standard Exchange Format for Software-Verification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21509v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past two decades, significant research and development effort went into the development of verification tools for individual languages, such asC, C++, and Java. Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Behavioural Conformances via Fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18509v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as \emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.</p></details> |  |

We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm_smi_lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also, we found gaps in the AMD tooling used on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms-1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

| **[MemFine: Memory-Aware Fine-Grained Scheduling for MoE Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21431v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Dynamic AI Inference Scaling on HPC-Infrastructure: Integrating Kubernetes, Slurm and vLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21413v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[QiMeng-CRUX: Narrowing the Gap between Natural Language and Verilog via Core Refined Understanding eXpression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20099v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in hardware description language (HDL) generation. However, existing approaches often rely on free-form natural language descriptions that are often ambiguous, redundant, and unstructured, which poses significant challenges for downstream Verilog code generation. We treat hardware code generation as a complex transformation from an open-ended natural language space to a domain-specific, highly constrained target space. To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

| **[Towards Computational UIP in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21209v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Some advantages of Cubical Type Theory, as implemented by Cubical Agda, over intensional Martin-Löf Type Theory include Quotient Inductive Types (QITs), which exist as instances of Higher Inductive Types, and functional extensionality, which is provable in Cubical Type Theory. However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a "h-Set Cubical Type Theory" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs. However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating "type formers preserve h-levels" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures. Version accepted at APLAS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Handling of Memory Page Faults during Virtual-Address RDMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them. State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux. This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Master of Science (MSc) Thesis 2019.

| **[IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality. First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically. Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anton...</summary><p>Antonis Psistakis, Bachelor of Science (BSc) Thesis 2017.

| **[A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Aragog: Just-in-Time Model Routing for Scalable Serving of Agentic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20975v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</p></details> |  |
