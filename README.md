| **[Breaking the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Distributed Storage with Quantum Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10676v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.</p></details> |  |

SSFL identifies a sparse subnetwork prior to training, leveraging parameter saliency scores computed separately on local client data in non-IID scenarios, and then aggregated, to determine a global mask. Only the sparse model weights are trained and communicated each round between the clients and the server. On standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, SSFL consistently improves the accuracy sparsity trade off, achieving more than 20\% relative error reduction on CIFAR-10 compared to the strongest sparse baseline, while reducing communication costs by $2 \times$ relative to dense FL. Finally, in a real-world federated learning deployment, SSFL delivers over $2.3 \times$ faster communication time, underscoring its practical efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Python based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": >= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N >= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-term Monitoring of Kernel and Hardware Events to Understand Latency Variance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10572v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our experience to understand latency variance caused by kernel and hardware events, which are often invisible at the application level. For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user. VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chebyshev Accelerated Subspsace Eigensolver for Pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10557v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying the optoelectronic structure of materials can require the computation of up to several thousands of the smallest eigenpairs of a pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian. Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to SISC</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Edge Inference for Distributed MoE Models with Latency-Optimized Expert Placement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12851v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has transformed the scaling of large language models by enabling vast model capacity through sparse activation. Yet, converting these performance gains into practical edge deployment remains difficult, as the massive memory footprint and communication demands often overwhelm resource-limited environments. While centralized cloud-based solutions are available, they are frequently plagued by prohibitive infrastructure costs, latency issues, and privacy concerns. Moreover, existing edge-oriented optimizations largely overlook the complexities of heterogeneous hardware, focusing instead on isolated or uniform device setups. In response, this paper proposes Prism, an inference framework engineered for collaborative MoE serving across diverse GPU-equipped edge servers. By leveraging the intrinsic sparsity and input locality of MoE workloads, Prism minimizes inter-server communication and optimizes expert placement within diverse resource constraints. The framework integrates an activation-aware placement strategy that balances local request coverage with memory utilization, supplemented by a runtime migration mechanism to adapt expert distribution to dynamic workload changes. Experiments on contemporary MoE models and datasets demonstrate that Prism reduces inference latency by up to 30.6% and significantly lowers communication costs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the effectiveness of cooperative edge-based MoE serving.</p></details> |  |
| **[NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating Point Support for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02024v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meeting service-level objectives (SLOs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving is critical, but managing the high variability in load presents a significant challenge. Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory-efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.</p></details> |  |
| **[HP2C-DT: High-Precision High-Performance Computer-enabled Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10523v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins are transforming the way we monitor, analyze, and control physical systems, but designing architectures that balance real-time responsiveness with heavy computational demands remains a challenge. Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints, while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations and data-driven optimizations. To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum. Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to 2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of handling real-world complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures.

| **[SCRamble: Adaptive Decentralized Overlay Construction for Blockchain Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10277v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being under development for over 15 years, transaction throughput remains one of the key challenges confronting blockchains, which typically has a cap of a limited number of transactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the network latency associated with the block propagation throughout of the underlying peer-to-peer network, typically formed through random connections. Accelerating the dissemination of blocks not only improves transaction rates, but also enhances system security by reducing the probability of forks. This paper introduces SCRamble: a decentralized protocol that significantly reduces block dissemination time in blockchain networks. SCRamble's effectiveness is attributed to its innovative link selection strategy, which integrates two heuristics: a scoring mechanism that assesses block arrival times from neighboring peers, and a second heuristic that takes network latency into account.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, The 27th ACM International Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking, ACM ICDCN 2026</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Linearly Separable Computation with Arbitrary Heterogeneous Data Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10177v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed linearly separable computation is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed systems, requiring the computation of linearly separable functions over different datasets across distributed workers. This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs. In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</p></details> |  |

The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fuzzychain-edge: A novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10105v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergency Department Patient Flow Optimization with an Alternative Care Threshold Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10041v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Clustering-Based User Selection in Federated Learning: Metadata Exploitation for 3GPP Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10013v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in 2026 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</p></details> |
| **[Fine-grained MoE Load Balancing with Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16947v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising approach to scale up deep learning models due to its significant reduction in computational resources. However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency. We propose a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. Our system is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally Accepted at ESOP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Federated Unlearning in Edge Networks: A Survey of Fundamentals, Challenges, Practical Applications and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09978v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected devices and privacy-sensitive applications has accelerated the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities. By consolidating existing knowledge and mapping open problems, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance FL to build trustworthy, regulation-compliant and user-centric federated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Memory Footprint Crisis: System Design for Production Diffusion LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17077v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.

The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to SISC</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Edge Inference for Distributed MoE Models with Latency-Optimized Expert Placement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12851v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has transformed the scaling of large language models by enabling vast model capacity through sparse activation. Yet, converting these performance gains into practical edge deployment remains difficult, as the massive memory footprint and communication demands often overwhelm resource-limited environments. While centralized cloud-based solutions are available, they are frequently plagued by prohibitive infrastructure costs, latency issues, and privacy concerns. Moreover, existing edge-oriented optimizations largely overlook the complexities of heterogeneous hardware, focusing instead on isolated or uniform device setups. In response, this paper proposes Prism, an inference framework engineered for collaborative MoE serving across diverse GPU-equipped edge servers. By leveraging the intrinsic sparsity and input locality of MoE workloads, Prism minimizes inter-server communication and optimizes expert placement within diverse resource constraints. The framework integrates an activation-aware placement strategy that balances local request coverage with memory utilization, supplemented by a runtime migration mechanism to adapt expert distribution to dynamic workload changes. Experiments on contemporary MoE models and datasets demonstrate that Prism reduces inference latency by up to 30.6% and significantly lowers communication costs compared to state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the effectiveness of cooperative edge-based MoE serving.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory-efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.</p></details> |  |

Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints, while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations and data-driven optimizations. To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum. Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to 2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of handling real-world complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Distributed Linearly Separable Computation with Arbitrary Heterogeneous Data Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10177v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed linearly separable computation is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed systems, requiring the computation of linearly separable functions over different datasets across distributed workers. This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs. In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fuzzychain-edge: A novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10105v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergency Department Patient Flow Optimization with an Alternative Care Threshold Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10041v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in 2026 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</p></details> |

However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency. We propose a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. Our system is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

| **[Federated Unlearning in Edge Networks: A Survey of Fundamentals, Challenges, Practical Applications and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09978v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected devices and privacy-sensitive applications has accelerated the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities. By consolidating existing knowledge and mapping open problems, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance FL to build trustworthy, regulation-compliant and user-centric federated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Memory Footprint Crisis: System Design for Production Diffusion LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17077v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.</p></details> |  |

SSFL identifies a sparse subnetwork prior to training, leveraging parameter saliency scores computed separately on local client data in non-IID scenarios, and then aggregated, to determine a global mask. Only the sparse model weights are trained and communicated each round between the clients and the server. On standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, SSFL consistently improves the accuracy sparsity trade off, achieving more than 20\% relative error reduction on CIFAR-10 compared to the strongest sparse baseline, while reducing communication costs by $2 \times$ relative to dense FL. Finally, in a real-world federated learning deployment, SSFL delivers over $2.3 \times$ faster communication time, underscoring its practical efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2026</p></details> |

We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": >= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N >= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user. VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Linearly Separable Computation with Arbitrary Heterogeneous Data Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10177v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed linearly separable computation is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed systems, requiring the computation of linearly separable functions over different datasets across distributed workers. This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Threaded Software Model Checking via Parallel Trace Abstraction Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13699v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic software verification is a valuable means for software quality assurance. However, automatic verification and in particular software model checking can be time-consuming, which hinders their practical applicability e.g., the use in continuous integration. One solution to address the issue is to reduce the response time of the verification procedure by leveraging today's multi-core CPUs. In this paper, we propose a solution to parallelize trace abstraction, an abstraction-based approach to software model checking. The underlying idea of our approach is to parallelize the abstraction refinement. More concretely, our approach analyzes different traces (syntactic program paths) that could violate the safety property in parallel. We realize our parallelized version of trace abstraction in the verification tool Ulti mate Automizer and perform a thorough evaluation. Our evaluation shows that our parallelization is more effective than sequential trace abstraction and can provide results significantly faster on many time-consuming tasks. Also, our approach is more effective than DSS, a recent parallel approach to abstraction-based software model checking.</p></details> |  |

The first two were formally verified in a previous paper using the CSP process algebra, and in this paper, we use the same approach to formally verify the third one, in two phases. In the first phase, we construct the CSP model as a faithful representation of the real Python code. In the second phase, the model checker PAT automatically proves correctness of the third generic algorithm by proving its deadlock freeness (safety property) and successful termination (liveness property).</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fuzzychain-edge: A novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10105v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergency Department Patient Flow Optimization with an Alternative Care Threshold Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10041v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.</p></details> | 37 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Clustering-Based User Selection in Federated Learning: Metadata Exploitation for 3GPP Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10013v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in 2026 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)</p></details> |
| **[Fine-grained MoE Load Balancing with Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16947v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising approach to scale up deep learning models due to its significant reduction in computational resources. However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency. We propose a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. Our system is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally Accepted at ESOP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Federated Unlearning in Edge Networks: A Survey of Fundamentals, Challenges, Practical Applications and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09978v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected devices and privacy-sensitive applications has accelerated the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities. By consolidating existing knowledge and mapping open problems, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance FL to build trustworthy, regulation-compliant and user-centric federated systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Memory Footprint Crisis: System Design for Production Diffusion LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17077v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Models (ARMs), utilizing parallel decoding to overcome sequential bottlenecks. However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical "memory footprint crisis" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound "Refresh" phases and bandwidth-bound "Reuse" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\times$-1.81$\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\times$-1.74$\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware.
