| **[Bootstrapping Fuzzers for Compilers of Low-Resource Language Dialects Using Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05887v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern extensible compiler frameworks-such as MLIR-enable rapid creation of domain-specific language dialects. This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise Reasoning About Container-Internal Pointers with Logical Pinning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23229v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most separation logics hide container-internal pointers for modularity. This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator for representing partial data structures, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes the way representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will appear in CPP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01678v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Embedding Bag Performance in DLRM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05831v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the size of DLRMs gets larger, the models must be partitioned across multiple GPUs or nodes of GPUs due to the size limitation of total HBM memory that can be packaged in a GPU. This partitioning adds communication and synchronization overhead of sending and receiving data across GPUs. We use the NCCL and NVSHMEM libraries to measure the performance of an Embedding Bag kernel implemented on H100 GPUs. We compare its performance across diOerent batch sizes, number of tables, table sizes, pooling factors, and embedding dimensions. For a large embedding table that spans multiple GPUs, we project the performance slowdown from distributing an embedding table across multiple GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice architecture, where isomorphic workers process client requests, recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, modifications to service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding inconsistencies from mixed-mode operation, caused by workers of current and new versions interacting via the data store. Some update methods avoid mixed-mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving throughput. The alternative is an uncontrolled ``rolling'' update, which runs the risk of serious service failures arising from inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. In this paper, we introduce a framework that formalizes this intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about update consistency. We apply this theory to derive the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for mixed-mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service actions, such as commutativity. We show that this is unavoidable, by proving that any semantically oblivious mixed-mode update method must allow inconsistencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Distributed MLLM Training with Cornstarch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11367v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by combining heterogeneous model architectures to handle diverse modalities like images and audio. However, this inherent heterogeneity in MLLM model structure and data types makes makeshift extensions to existing LLM training frameworks unsuitable for efficient MLLM training. While there are a few works that have attempted to address the heterogeneity in MLLM training, their approaches are limited to only superficially considering the characteristics of MLLMs. In this paper, we present Cornstarch, an efficient distributed MLLM training framework that contemplates MLLM's unique characteristics in both model and data parallelization. Cornstarch introduces frozen-aware pipeline parallelism and token workload-balanced context parallelism to improve MLLM training throughput. Our extensive evaluation shows that Cornstarch outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by $2.26\times$ on average in terms of MLLM training throughput. Cornstarch is an open-source project available at https://github.com/cornstarch-org/Cornstarch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Self-Stabilising Leader Election for Programmable Matter with Constant Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08775v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of electing a unique leader is central to all distributed systems, including programmable matter systems where particles have constant size memory. In this paper, we present a silent self-stabilising, deterministic, stationary, election algorithm for particles having constant memory, assuming that the system is simply connected. Our algorithm is elegant and simple, and requires constant memory per particle. We prove that our algorithm always stabilises to a configuration with a unique leader, under a daemon satisfying some fairness guarantees (Gouda fairness [Gouda 2001]). We use the special geometric properties of programmable matter in 2D triangular grids to obtain the first self-stabilising algorithm for such systems. This result is surprising since it is known that silent self-stabilising algorithms for election in general distributed networks require $Ω(\log{n})$ bits of memory per node, even for ring topologies [Dolev et al. 1999].</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, full version of the paper accepted at DISC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Compiling Away the Overhead of Race Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05555v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic data race detectors are indispensable for flagging concurrency errors in software, but their high runtime overhead limits their adoption. This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers. Our optimizations have been accepted by the ThreadSanitizer maintainers and are in the process of being upstreamed.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiler-supported reduced precision and AoS-SoA transformations for heterogeneous hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05516v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates AoS-to-SoA transformations over reduced-precision data layouts for a particle simulation code on several GPU platforms: We hypothesize that SoA fits particularly well to SIMT, while AoS is the preferred storage format for many Lagrangian codes. Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orders in Chaos: Enhancing Large-Scale MoE LLM Serving with Data Movement Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05497v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently become the frontier open weight models, achieving remarkable model capability similar to proprietary ones. But their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit LLM serving systems. To understand the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across four state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models released in 2025 (200B-1000B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. We perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. With our insights, we then demonstrate how to improve wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, and show that minor architectural modifications leveraging the insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 5.3x and 3.1x average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work presents the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of large-scale MoE models and a concrete design study using the learned lessons, with profiling traces and simulation framework already open-sourced with $>$1k downloads. Our traces and results are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/core12345/MoE_expert_selection_trace</p></details> |  |

The platform supports Large Language Model (LLM) Agents and Generative AI-based tools to perform ML model management tasks in our Machine Learning operations (MLOps) pipelines, such as the dynamic consensus model, a model that aggregates several scientific computational models, registration and management, retrieving model information, asynchronous submission/execution of models, and receiving results once the model complete executions. The platform includes a Model Owner Control Panel, Platform Admin Tools, and Model Gateway API service for interacting with the platform and tracking model execution. The platform achieves a 0% failure rate when testing scaling beyond 10k simultaneous application clients consume models. The Model Gateway is a fundamental part of our model-driven drug discovery pipeline. It has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of new drugs with the maturity of our MLOps infrastructure and the integration of LLM Agents and Generative AI tools.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

| **[A Scene-aware Models Adaptation Scheme for Cross-scene Online Inference on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03331v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications desire online prediction using deep neural network (DNN) models on mobile devices. However, due to the movement of devices, unfamiliar test samples constantly appear, significantly affecting the prediction accuracy of a pre-trained DNN. In addition, unstable network connection calls for local model inference. In this paper, we propose a light-weight scheme, called Anole, to cope with the local DNN model inference on mobile devices. The core idea of Anole is to first establish an army of compact DNN models, and then adaptively select the model fitting the current test sample best for online inference. The key is to automatically identify model-friendly scenes for training scene-specific DNN models. To this end, we design a weakly-supervised scene representation learning algorithm by combining both human heuristics and feature similarity in separating scenes. Moreover, we further train a model classifier to predict the best-fit scene-specific DNN model for each test sample. We implement Anole on different types of mobile devices and conduct extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The results demonstrate that Anole outwits the method of using a versatile large DNN in terms of prediction accuracy (4.5% higher), response time (33.1% faster) and power consumption (45.1% lower).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version presents the extended and revised journal version of our 2024 conference paper, incorporating new datasets, expanded evaluations, and improved methodological details.

| **[FedGMR: Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05372v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) holds strong potential for distributed machine learning, but in heterogeneous environments, Bandwidth-Constrained Clients (BCCs) often struggle to participate effectively due to limited communication capacity. Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clock2Q+: A Simple and Efficient Replacement Algorithm for Metadata Cache in VMware vSAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21958v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Verified VCG and Verified Compiler for Dafny](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05262v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dafny is a verification-aware programming language that comes with a compiler and static program verifier. However, neither the compiler nor the verifier is proved correct; in fact, soundness bugs have been found in both tools. This paper shows that the aforementioned Dafny tools can be developed with foundational correctness guarantees. We present a functional big-step semantics for an imperative subset of Dafny and, based on this semantics, a verified verification condition generator (VCG) and a verified compiler for Dafny. The subset of Dafny we have formalized includes mutually recursive method calls, while loops, and arrays -- these language features are significant enough to cover challenging examples such as McCarthy's 91 function and array-based programs that are used when teaching Dafny. The verified VCG allows one to prove functional correctness of annotated Dafny programs, while the verified compiler can be used to compile verified Dafny programs to CakeML programs. From there, one can obtain executable machine code via the (already verified) CakeML compiler, all while provably maintaining the functional correctness guarantees that were proved for the source-level Dafny programs. Our work has been mechanized in the HOL4 theorem prover.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures. To be published in CPP 2026.

| **[NVLang: Unified Static Typing for Actor-Based Concurrency on the BEAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05224v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-based systems like Erlang/OTP power critical infrastructure -- from telecommunications to messaging platforms -- handling millions of concurrent connections with legendary reliability. Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures. We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns. By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.</p></details> | 4 figures, 2 tables |

The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 16 figures, 13 tables, presented at the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics conference</p></details> |

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.</p></details> |  |

| **[Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01678v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dissecting Embedding Bag Performance in DLRM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05831v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the size of DLRMs gets larger, the models must be partitioned across multiple GPUs or nodes of GPUs due to the size limitation of total HBM memory that can be packaged in a GPU. This partitioning adds communication and synchronization overhead of sending and receiving data across GPUs. We use the NCCL and NVSHMEM libraries to measure the performance of an Embedding Bag kernel implemented on H100 GPUs. We compare its performance across diOerent batch sizes, number of tables, table sizes, pooling factors, and embedding dimensions. For a large embedding table that spans multiple GPUs, we project the performance slowdown from distributing an embedding table across multiple GPUs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice architecture, where isomorphic workers process client requests, recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, modifications to service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding inconsistencies from mixed-mode operation, caused by workers of current and new versions interacting via the data store. Some update methods avoid mixed-mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving throughput. The alternative is an uncontrolled ``rolling'' update, which runs the risk of serious service failures arising from inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. In this paper, we introduce a framework that formalizes this intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about update consistency. We apply this theory to derive the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for mixed-mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service actions, such as commutativity. We show that this is unavoidable, by proving that any semantically oblivious mixed-mode update method must allow inconsistencies.</p></details> |  |

However, this inherent heterogeneity in MLLM model structure and data types makes makeshift extensions to existing LLM training frameworks unsuitable for efficient MLLM training. While there are a few works that have attempted to address the heterogeneity in MLLM training, their approaches are limited to only superficially considering the characteristics of MLLMs. In this paper, we present Cornstarch, an efficient distributed MLLM training framework that contemplates MLLM's unique characteristics in both model and data parallelization. Cornstarch introduces frozen-aware pipeline parallelism and token workload-balanced context parallelism to improve MLLM training throughput. Our extensive evaluation shows that Cornstarch outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by $2.26\times$ on average in terms of MLLM training throughput.

| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a silent self-stabilising, deterministic, stationary, election algorithm for particles having constant memory, assuming that the system is simply connected. Our algorithm is elegant and simple, and requires constant memory per particle. We prove that our algorithm always stabilises to a configuration with a unique leader, under a daemon satisfying some fairness guarantees (Gouda fairness [Gouda 2001]). We use the special geometric properties of programmable matter in 2D triangular grids to obtain the first self-stabilising algorithm for such systems. This result is surprising since it is known that silent self-stabilising algorithms for election in general distributed networks require $Ω(\log{n})$ bits of memory per node, even for ring topologies [Dolev et al. 1999].</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, full version of the paper accepted at DISC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Compiling Away the Overhead of Race Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05555v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic data race detectors are indispensable for flagging concurrency errors in software, but their high runtime overhead limits their adoption. This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers. Our optimizations have been accepted by the ThreadSanitizer maintainers and are in the process of being upstreamed.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiler-supported reduced precision and AoS-SoA transformations for heterogeneous hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05516v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates AoS-to-SoA transformations over reduced-precision data layouts for a particle simulation code on several GPU platforms: We hypothesize that SoA fits particularly well to SIMT, while AoS is the preferred storage format for many Lagrangian codes. Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.</p></details> |  |

But their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit LLM serving systems. To understand the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across four state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models released in 2025 (200B-1000B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. We perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. With our insights, we then demonstrate how to improve wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, and show that minor architectural modifications leveraging the insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 5.3x and 3.1x average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work presents the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of large-scale MoE models and a concrete design study using the learned lessons, with profiling traces and simulation framework already open-sourced with $>$1k downloads.

| **[A Scene-aware Models Adaptation Scheme for Cross-scene Online Inference on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03331v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications desire online prediction using deep neural network (DNN) models on mobile devices. However, due to the movement of devices, unfamiliar test samples constantly appear, significantly affecting the prediction accuracy of a pre-trained DNN. In addition, unstable network connection calls for local model inference. In this paper, we propose a light-weight scheme, called Anole, to cope with the local DNN model inference on mobile devices. The core idea of Anole is to first establish an army of compact DNN models, and then adaptively select the model fitting the current test sample best for online inference. The key is to automatically identify model-friendly scenes for training scene-specific DNN models. To this end, we design a weakly-supervised scene representation learning algorithm by combining both human heuristics and feature similarity in separating scenes. Moreover, we further train a model classifier to predict the best-fit scene-specific DNN model for each test sample. We implement Anole on different types of mobile devices and conduct extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The results demonstrate that Anole outwits the method of using a versatile large DNN in terms of prediction accuracy (4.5% higher), response time (33.1% faster) and power consumption (45.1% lower).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version presents the extended and revised journal version of our 2024 conference paper, incorporating new datasets, expanded evaluations, and improved methodological details.

Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

However, neither the compiler nor the verifier is proved correct; in fact, soundness bugs have been found in both tools. This paper shows that the aforementioned Dafny tools can be developed with foundational correctness guarantees. We present a functional big-step semantics for an imperative subset of Dafny and, based on this semantics, a verified verification condition generator (VCG) and a verified compiler for Dafny. The subset of Dafny we have formalized includes mutually recursive method calls, while loops, and arrays -- these language features are significant enough to cover challenging examples such as McCarthy's 91 function and array-based programs that are used when teaching Dafny. The verified VCG allows one to prove functional correctness of annotated Dafny programs, while the verified compiler can be used to compile verified Dafny programs to CakeML programs. From there, one can obtain executable machine code via the (already verified) CakeML compiler, all while provably maintaining the functional correctness guarantees that were proved for the source-level Dafny programs.

Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures. We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns. By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.</p></details> | 4 figures, 2 tables |

The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 16 figures, 13 tables, presented at the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics conference</p></details> |

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.</p></details> |  |

This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator for representing partial data structures, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes the way representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will appear in CPP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01678v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.</p></details> |  |

To maintain service, modifications to service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding inconsistencies from mixed-mode operation, caused by workers of current and new versions interacting via the data store. Some update methods avoid mixed-mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving throughput. The alternative is an uncontrolled ``rolling'' update, which runs the risk of serious service failures arising from inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. In this paper, we introduce a framework that formalizes this intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about update consistency. We apply this theory to derive the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for mixed-mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service actions, such as commutativity.

| **[Metronome: Differentiated Delay Scheduling for Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05703v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for its ease-of-management and elasticity. However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Self-Stabilising Leader Election for Programmable Matter with Constant Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08775v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of electing a unique leader is central to all distributed systems, including programmable matter systems where particles have constant size memory. In this paper, we present a silent self-stabilising, deterministic, stationary, election algorithm for particles having constant memory, assuming that the system is simply connected. Our algorithm is elegant and simple, and requires constant memory per particle. We prove that our algorithm always stabilises to a configuration with a unique leader, under a daemon satisfying some fairness guarantees (Gouda fairness [Gouda 2001]). We use the special geometric properties of programmable matter in 2D triangular grids to obtain the first self-stabilising algorithm for such systems. This result is surprising since it is known that silent self-stabilising algorithms for election in general distributed networks require $Ω(\log{n})$ bits of memory per node, even for ring topologies [Dolev et al. 1999].</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, full version of the paper accepted at DISC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Compiling Away the Overhead of Race Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05555v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic data race detectors are indispensable for flagging concurrency errors in software, but their high runtime overhead limits their adoption. This overhead stems primarily from pervasive instrumentation of memory accesses - a significant fraction of which is redundant. We addresses this inefficiency through a static, compiler-integrated approach that identifies and eliminates redundant instrumentation, drastically reducing the runtime cost of dynamic data race detectors. We introduce a suite of interprocedural static analyses reasoning about memory access patterns, synchronization, and thread creation to eliminate instrumentation for provably race-free accesses and show that the completeness properties of the data race detector are preserved. We further observe that many inserted checks flag a race if and only if a preceding check has already flagged an equivalent race for the same memory location - albeit potentially at a different access. We characterize this notion of equivalence and show that, when limiting reporting to at least one representative for each equivalence class, a further class of redundant checks can be eliminated. We identify such accesses using a novel dominance-based elimination analysis. Based on these two insights, we have implemented five static analyses within the LLVM, integrated with the instrumentation pass of the race detector ThreadSanitizer. Our experimental evaluation on a diverse suite of real-world applications demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces race detection overhead, achieving a geomean speedup of 1.34x, with peak speedups reaching 2.5x under high thread contention. This performance is achieved with a negligible increase in compilation time and, being fully automatic, places no additional burden on developers. Our optimizations have been accepted by the ThreadSanitizer maintainers and are in the process of being upstreamed.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiler-supported reduced precision and AoS-SoA transformations for heterogeneous hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05516v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates AoS-to-SoA transformations over reduced-precision data layouts for a particle simulation code on several GPU platforms: We hypothesize that SoA fits particularly well to SIMT, while AoS is the preferred storage format for many Lagrangian codes. Reduced-precision (below IEEE accuracy) is an established tool to address bandwidth constraints, although it remains unclear whether AoS and precision conversions should execute on a CPU or be deployed to a GPU if the compute kernel itself must run on an accelerator. On modern superchips where CPUs and GPUs share (logically) one data space, it is also unclear whether it is advantageous to stream data to the accelerator prior to the calculation, or whether we should let the accelerator transform data on demand, i.e.~work in-place logically. We therefore introduce compiler annotations to facilitate such conversions and to give the programmer the option to orchestrate the conversions in combination with GPU offloading. For some of our compute kernels of interest, Nvidia's G200 platforms yield a speedup of around 2.6 while AMD's MI300A exhibits more robust performance yet profits less. We assume that our compiler-based techniques are applicable to a wide variety of Lagrangian codes and beyond.</p></details> |  |

But their random expert selection mechanism introduces significant data movement overhead that becomes the dominant bottleneck in multi-unit LLM serving systems. To understand the patterns underlying this data movement, we conduct comprehensive data-movement-centric profiling across four state-of-the-art large-scale MoE models released in 2025 (200B-1000B) using over 24,000 requests spanning diverse workloads. We perform systematic analysis from both temporal and spatial perspectives and distill six key insights to guide the design of diverse future serving systems. With our insights, we then demonstrate how to improve wafer-scale GPUs as a case study, and show that minor architectural modifications leveraging the insights achieve substantial performance gains, delivering 5.3x and 3.1x average speedups on DeepSeek V3 and Qwen3, respectively. Our work presents the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of large-scale MoE models and a concrete design study using the learned lessons, with profiling traces and simulation framework already open-sourced with $>$1k downloads. Our traces and results are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/core12345/MoE_expert_selection_trace</p></details> |  |

The platform supports Large Language Model (LLM) Agents and Generative AI-based tools to perform ML model management tasks in our Machine Learning operations (MLOps) pipelines, such as the dynamic consensus model, a model that aggregates several scientific computational models, registration and management, retrieving model information, asynchronous submission/execution of models, and receiving results once the model complete executions. The platform includes a Model Owner Control Panel, Platform Admin Tools, and Model Gateway API service for interacting with the platform and tracking model execution. The platform achieves a 0% failure rate when testing scaling beyond 10k simultaneous application clients consume models. The Model Gateway is a fundamental part of our model-driven drug discovery pipeline. It has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of new drugs with the maturity of our MLOps infrastructure and the integration of LLM Agents and Generative AI tools.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

| **[A Scene-aware Models Adaptation Scheme for Cross-scene Online Inference on Mobile Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03331v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications desire online prediction using deep neural network (DNN) models on mobile devices. However, due to the movement of devices, unfamiliar test samples constantly appear, significantly affecting the prediction accuracy of a pre-trained DNN. In addition, unstable network connection calls for local model inference. In this paper, we propose a light-weight scheme, called Anole, to cope with the local DNN model inference on mobile devices. The core idea of Anole is to first establish an army of compact DNN models, and then adaptively select the model fitting the current test sample best for online inference. The key is to automatically identify model-friendly scenes for training scene-specific DNN models. To this end, we design a weakly-supervised scene representation learning algorithm by combining both human heuristics and feature similarity in separating scenes. Moreover, we further train a model classifier to predict the best-fit scene-specific DNN model for each test sample. We implement Anole on different types of mobile devices and conduct extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The results demonstrate that Anole outwits the method of using a versatile large DNN in terms of prediction accuracy (4.5% higher), response time (33.1% faster) and power consumption (45.1% lower).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version presents the extended and revised journal version of our 2024 conference paper, incorporating new datasets, expanded evaluations, and improved methodological details.

| **[FedGMR: Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05372v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) holds strong potential for distributed machine learning, but in heterogeneous environments, Bandwidth-Constrained Clients (BCCs) often struggle to participate effectively due to limited communication capacity. Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clock2Q+: A Simple and Efficient Replacement Algorithm for Metadata Cache in VMware vSAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21958v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Verified VCG and Verified Compiler for Dafny](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05262v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dafny is a verification-aware programming language that comes with a compiler and static program verifier. However, neither the compiler nor the verifier is proved correct; in fact, soundness bugs have been found in both tools. This paper shows that the aforementioned Dafny tools can be developed with foundational correctness guarantees. We present a functional big-step semantics for an imperative subset of Dafny and, based on this semantics, a verified verification condition generator (VCG) and a verified compiler for Dafny. The subset of Dafny we have formalized includes mutually recursive method calls, while loops, and arrays -- these language features are significant enough to cover challenging examples such as McCarthy's 91 function and array-based programs that are used when teaching Dafny. The verified VCG allows one to prove functional correctness of annotated Dafny programs, while the verified compiler can be used to compile verified Dafny programs to CakeML programs. From there, one can obtain executable machine code via the (already verified) CakeML compiler, all while provably maintaining the functional correctness guarantees that were proved for the source-level Dafny programs. Our work has been mechanized in the HOL4 theorem prover.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures. To be published in CPP 2026.

| **[NVLang: Unified Static Typing for Actor-Based Concurrency on the BEAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05224v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-based systems like Erlang/OTP power critical infrastructure -- from telecommunications to messaging platforms -- handling millions of concurrent connections with legendary reliability. Yet these systems lack static guarantees about message protocols: processes communicate by sending arbitrary messages that pattern-matched at runtime, deferring protocol violations to production failures. We present NVLang, a statically typed functional language that brings comprehensive type safety to the BEAM virtual machine while preserving actor model's simplicity and power. NVLang's central contribution that algebraic data types (ADTs) naturally encode actor message protocols: each actor declares the sum type representing its message vocabulary, and the type system enforces protocol conformance at compile time. We introduce typed process identifiers (Pid[T]) that encode the protocol an actor expects, and typed futures (Future[T]) that provide type-safe request-reply patterns. By extending Hindley-Milner type inference to track message protocols, NVLang eliminates an entire class of message-passing errors while maintaining clean syntax that rivals dynamically typed alternatives. Our implementation compiles to Core Erlang, enabling seamless interoperability with the existing Erlang ecosystem. We formalize the type system and provide proof sketches for type soundness, demonstrating that well-typed NVLang programs cannot send messages that violate actor protocols.</p></details> | 4 figures, 2 tables |

The first method integrates multiple software tools into a single pipeline which can generate adaptive anisotropic meshes from segmented medical images. The pipeline is shown to satisfy quality, fidelity, smoothness, and robustness requirements while providing near real-time performance for medical image-to-mesh conversion. The second method approximates a user-defined sizing function to generate adaptive isotropic meshes of good quality and fidelity in real-time. Tested with two brain aneurysm cases and utilizing up to 96 CPU cores within a single, multicore node on Purdue University's Anvil supercomputer, the parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing method utilizes a hierarchical load balancing model (designed for large, cc-NUMA shared memory architectures) and contains an optimized local reconnection operation that performs three times faster than its original implementation from previous studies. The adaptive isotropic method is shown to generate a mesh of up to approximately 50 million elements in less than a minute while the adaptive anisotropic method is shown to generate approximately the same number of elements in about 5 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 16 figures, 13 tables, presented at the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics conference</p></details> |
