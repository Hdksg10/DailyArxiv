| **[Ridgeline: A 2D Roofline Model for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01368v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this short paper, we introduce the Ridgeline model, an extension of the Roofline model [4] for distributed systems. The Roofline model targets shared memory systems, bounding the performance of a kernel based on its operational intensity, and the peak compute throughput and memory bandwidth of the execution system. In a distributed setting, with multiple communicating compute entities, the network must be taken into account to model the system behavior accurately. The Ridgeline aggregates information on compute, memory, and network limits in one 2D plot to show, in an intuitive way, which of the resources is the expected bottleneck. We show the applicability of the Ridgeline in a case study based on a data-parallel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) instance.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Cost-Driven Synthesis of Sound Abstract Interpreters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13663v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing abstract interpreters that provide global soundness guarantees remains a major obstacle in abstract interpretation. We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.</p></details> | 37 pages, 20 figures |
| **[A Lightweight Approach for State Machine Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17771v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a lightweight solution for state machine replication with commitment certificates. Specifically, we adapt and analyze a median rule for the stabilizing consensus problem [Doerr11] to operate in a client-server setting where arbitrary servers may be blocked adaptively based on past system information. We further extend our protocol by compressing information about committed commands, thus keeping the protocol lightweight, while still enabling clients to easily prove that their commands have indeed been committed on the shared state. Our approach guarantees liveness as long as at most a constant fraction of servers are blocked, ensures safety under any number of blocked servers, and supports fast recovery even after all servers are blocked. In addition to offering near-optimal asymptotic performance in several respects, our method is fully decentralized, unlike other near-optimal solutions that rely on leaders. In particular, our solution is robust against adversaries that target key servers (which captures insider-based denial-of-service attacks), whereas leader-based approaches fail under such a blocking model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Glia: A Human-Inspired AI for Automated Systems Design and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27176v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mysticeti: Reaching the Limits of Latency with Uncertified DAGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14821v5)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Mysticeti-C, the first DAG-based Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve the lower bounds of latency of 3 message rounds. Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 200k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into the Sui blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymptotic analysis of cooperative censoring policies in sensor networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13492v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of cooperative data censoring in battery-powered multihop sensor networks is analyzed in this paper. We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic and Distributed Routing in IoT Networks based on Multi-Objective Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00918v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IoT networks often face conflicting routing goals such as maximizing packet delivery, minimizing delay, and conserving limited battery energy. These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols. These results demonstrate significant gains in adaptability, delivery, and efficiency for dynamic IoT environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardware optimization on Android for inference of AI models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13453v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence models into contemporary mobile computing is notable across numerous use cases, from virtual assistants to advanced image processing. Optimizing the mobile user experience involves minimal latency and high responsiveness from deployed AI models with challenges from execution strategies that fully leverage real time constraints to the exploitation of heterogeneous hardware architecture. In this paper, we research and propose the optimal execution configurations for AI models on an Android system, focusing on two critical tasks: object detection (YOLO family) and image classification (ResNet). These configurations evaluate various model quantization schemes and the utilization of on device accelerators, specifically the GPU and NPU. Our core objective is to empirically determine the combination that achieves the best trade-off between minimal accuracy degradation and maximal inference speed-up.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Evaluation of Domain-Specific Architectures for General-Purpose Applications in Apple Silicon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13450v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI and its growing computational demands have driven the integration of domain-specific accelerators (such as GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs) across the entire computing infrastructure. Following the precedent set by the GPGPU which popularized GPUs for general-purpose tasks, this research asks whether this phenomenon can be replicated with specialized accelerators like NPUs in new contexts. This paper evaluates the potential of the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) designed for high energy efficiency in Machine Learning workloads, in the context of general-purpose HPC applications. We evaluate the performance and energy consumption of classic HPC algorithms such as GEMM, Jacobi or Multigrid methods on Apple's ANE across the M1 and the latest M4 architectures. Results confirm that, when algorithms are properly adapted, the ANE achieves competitive performance (up to 3.8 TFlops on the M4-Pro, comparable to the GPU's 4.7 TFlops on the same SoC for GEMM operation) while demonstrating significantly superior energy efficiency (e.g., GEMM consumes 5.2 Watts on the ANE versus 24 Watts on GPU counterpart in M4 architectures).</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, IEEE Format, IPDPS Submission (In revision), 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11560v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI 2026 (oral presentation).

| **[InfoDecom: Decomposing Information for Defending against Privacy Leakage in Split Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13365v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split inference (SI) enables users to access deep learning (DL) services without directly transmitting raw data. However, recent studies reveal that data reconstruction attacks (DRAs) can recover the original inputs from the smashed data sent from the client to the server, leading to significant privacy leakage. While various defenses have been proposed, they often result in substantial utility degradation, particularly when the client-side model is shallow. We identify a key cause of this trade-off: existing defenses apply excessive perturbation to redundant information in the smashed data. To address this issue in computer vision tasks, we propose InfoDecom, a defense framework that first decomposes and removes redundant information and then injects noise calibrated to provide theoretically guaranteed privacy. Experiments demonstrate that InfoDecom achieves a superior utility-privacy trade-off compared to existing baselines. The code and the appendix are available at https://github.com/SASA-cloud/InfoDecom.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[KForge: Program Synthesis for Diverse AI Hardware Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13274v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms. We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at MLSys 2026</p></details> |
| **[From Semantics to Syntax: A Type Theory for Comprehension Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10868v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent models of intensional type theory have been constructed in algebraic weak factorization systems (AWFSs). AWFSs give rise to comprehension categories that feature non-trivial morphisms between types; these morphisms are not used in the standard interpretation of Martin-Löf type theory in comprehension categories. We develop a type theory that internalizes morphisms between types, reflecting this semantic feature back into syntax. Our type theory comes with $Π$-, $Σ$-, and identity types. We discuss how it can be viewed as an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with coercive subtyping, as sketched by Coraglia and Emmenegger. We furthermore define semantic structure that interprets our type theory and prove a soundness result. Finally, we exhibit many examples of the semantic structure, yielding a plethora of interpretations.</p></details> |  |

The Pico-Cloud delivers container-based virtualization, service discovery, and lightweight orchestration directly at the device layer, enabling local operation with low latency and low power consumption without reliance on centralized data centers. We present its architectural model, outline representative use cases including rural connectivity, educational clusters, and edge AI inference, and analyze design challenges in computation, networking, storage, and power management. The results highlight Pico-Clouds as a cost-effective, decentralized, and sustainable platform for lightweight distributed workloads at the network edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[CG-FedLLM: How to Compress Gradients in Federated Fune-tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13746v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive training data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized Learning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Process Energy Profiles from Node-Level Power Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13155v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for data center capacity, driven by the growth of high-performance computing, cloud computing, and especially artificial intelligence, has led to a sharp increase in data center energy consumption. To improve energy efficiency, gaining process-level insights into energy consumption is essential. While node-level energy consumption data can be directly measured with hardware such as power meters, existing mechanisms for estimating per-process energy usage, such as Intel RAPL, are limited to specific hardware and provide only coarse-grained, domain-level measurements. Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Multigrid with Adaptive Galerkin Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13109v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a robust, adaptive coarse-grid correction scheme for matrix-free geometric multigrid targeting PDEs with strongly varying coefficients. The method combines uniform geometric coarsening of the underlying grid with heterogeneous coarse-grid operators: Galerkin coarse grid approximation is applied locally in regions with large coefficient gradients, while lightweight, direct coarse grid approximation is used elsewhere. This selective application ensures that local Galerkin operators are computed and stored only where necessary, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining robust convergence. We demonstrate the method on a suite of sinker benchmark problems for the generalized Stokes equation, including grid-aligned and unaligned viscosity jumps, smoothly varying viscosity functions with large gradients, and different viscosity evaluation techniques. We analytically quantify the solver's memory consumption and demonstrate its efficiency by solving Stokes problems with $10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, viscosity jumps of $10^{6}$ magnitude, and more than 100{,}000 parallel processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MACKO: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication for Low Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13061v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in the inference of sparse Large Language Models (LLMs). Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + 7 pages appendix, 11 figures, Code available at https://github.com/vlejd/macko_spmv</p></details> |
| **[FlowLog: Efficient and Extensible Datalog via Incrementality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00865v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datalog-based languages are regaining popularity as a powerful abstraction for expressing recursive computations in domains such as program analysis and graph processing. However, existing systems often face a trade-off between efficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency through domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others, like RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases, but struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations. This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that uses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control (e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets us retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but also reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level (i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan reuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a robustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding worst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built atop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog supports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware optimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation shows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern databases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior scalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VLDB 2026</p></details> |

Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols. These results demonstrate significant gains in adaptability, delivery, and efficiency for dynamic IoT environments.</p></details> |  |

We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices.

Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes).

AWFSs give rise to comprehension categories that feature non-trivial morphisms between types; these morphisms are not used in the standard interpretation of Martin-Löf type theory in comprehension categories. We develop a type theory that internalizes morphisms between types, reflecting this semantic feature back into syntax. Our type theory comes with $Π$-, $Σ$-, and identity types. We discuss how it can be viewed as an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with coercive subtyping, as sketched by Coraglia and Emmenegger. We furthermore define semantic structure that interprets our type theory and prove a soundness result. Finally, we exhibit many examples of the semantic structure, yielding a plethora of interpretations.</p></details> |  |

| **[CG-FedLLM: How to Compress Gradients in Federated Fune-tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13746v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive training data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized Learning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Process Energy Profiles from Node-Level Power Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13155v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for data center capacity, driven by the growth of high-performance computing, cloud computing, and especially artificial intelligence, has led to a sharp increase in data center energy consumption. To improve energy efficiency, gaining process-level insights into energy consumption is essential. While node-level energy consumption data can be directly measured with hardware such as power meters, existing mechanisms for estimating per-process energy usage, such as Intel RAPL, are limited to specific hardware and provide only coarse-grained, domain-level measurements. Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Multigrid with Adaptive Galerkin Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13109v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a robust, adaptive coarse-grid correction scheme for matrix-free geometric multigrid targeting PDEs with strongly varying coefficients. The method combines uniform geometric coarsening of the underlying grid with heterogeneous coarse-grid operators: Galerkin coarse grid approximation is applied locally in regions with large coefficient gradients, while lightweight, direct coarse grid approximation is used elsewhere. This selective application ensures that local Galerkin operators are computed and stored only where necessary, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining robust convergence. We demonstrate the method on a suite of sinker benchmark problems for the generalized Stokes equation, including grid-aligned and unaligned viscosity jumps, smoothly varying viscosity functions with large gradients, and different viscosity evaluation techniques. We analytically quantify the solver's memory consumption and demonstrate its efficiency by solving Stokes problems with $10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, viscosity jumps of $10^{6}$ magnitude, and more than 100{,}000 parallel processes.</p></details> |  |

Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + 7 pages appendix, 11 figures, Code available at https://github.com/vlejd/macko_spmv</p></details> |

However, existing systems often face a trade-off between efficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency through domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others, like RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases, but struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations. This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that uses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control (e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets us retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but also reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level (i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan reuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a robustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding worst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built atop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog supports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware optimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation shows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern databases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior scalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VLDB 2026</p></details> |

The Roofline model targets shared memory systems, bounding the performance of a kernel based on its operational intensity, and the peak compute throughput and memory bandwidth of the execution system. In a distributed setting, with multiple communicating compute entities, the network must be taken into account to model the system behavior accurately. The Ridgeline aggregates information on compute, memory, and network limits in one 2D plot to show, in an intuitive way, which of the resources is the expected bottleneck. We show the applicability of the Ridgeline in a case study based on a data-parallel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) instance.</p></details> | 5 pages |

We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.</p></details> | 37 pages, 20 figures |
| **[A Lightweight Approach for State Machine Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17771v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a lightweight solution for state machine replication with commitment certificates. Specifically, we adapt and analyze a median rule for the stabilizing consensus problem [Doerr11] to operate in a client-server setting where arbitrary servers may be blocked adaptively based on past system information. We further extend our protocol by compressing information about committed commands, thus keeping the protocol lightweight, while still enabling clients to easily prove that their commands have indeed been committed on the shared state. Our approach guarantees liveness as long as at most a constant fraction of servers are blocked, ensures safety under any number of blocked servers, and supports fast recovery even after all servers are blocked. In addition to offering near-optimal asymptotic performance in several respects, our method is fully decentralized, unlike other near-optimal solutions that rely on leaders. In particular, our solution is robust against adversaries that target key servers (which captures insider-based denial-of-service attacks), whereas leader-based approaches fail under such a blocking model.</p></details> |  |

We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.</p></details> |  |

Since Mysticeti-C is built over DAGs it also achieves high resource efficiency and censorship resistance. Mysticeti-C achieves this latency improvement by avoiding explicit certification of the DAG blocks and by proposing a novel commit rule such that every block can be committed without delays, resulting in optimal latency in the steady state and under crash failures. We further extend Mysticeti-C to Mysticeti-FPC, which incorporates a fast commit path that achieves even lower latency for transferring assets. Unlike prior fast commit path protocols, Mysticeti-FPC minimizes the number of signatures and messages by weaving the fast path transactions into the DAG. This frees up resources, which subsequently result in better performance. We prove the safety and liveness in a Byzantine context. We evaluate both Mysticeti protocols and compare them with state-of-the-art consensus and fast path protocols to demonstrate their low latency and resource efficiency, as well as their more graceful degradation under crash failures. Mysticeti-C is the first Byzantine consensus protocol to achieve WAN latency of 0.5s for consensus commit while simultaneously maintaining state-of-the-art throughput of over 200k TPS. Finally, we report on integrating Mysticeti-C as the consensus protocol into the Sui blockchain, resulting in over 4x latency reduction.</p></details> |  |

We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes.</p></details> |  |

These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols. These results demonstrate significant gains in adaptability, delivery, and efficiency for dynamic IoT environments.</p></details> |  |

We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at MLSys 2026</p></details> |
| **[From Semantics to Syntax: A Type Theory for Comprehension Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10868v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent models of intensional type theory have been constructed in algebraic weak factorization systems (AWFSs). AWFSs give rise to comprehension categories that feature non-trivial morphisms between types; these morphisms are not used in the standard interpretation of Martin-Löf type theory in comprehension categories. We develop a type theory that internalizes morphisms between types, reflecting this semantic feature back into syntax. Our type theory comes with $Π$-, $Σ$-, and identity types. We discuss how it can be viewed as an extension of Martin-Löf type theory with coercive subtyping, as sketched by Coraglia and Emmenegger. We furthermore define semantic structure that interprets our type theory and prove a soundness result. Finally, we exhibit many examples of the semantic structure, yielding a plethora of interpretations.</p></details> |  |

| **[CG-FedLLM: How to Compress Gradients in Federated Fune-tuning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13746v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive training data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized Learning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Process Energy Profiles from Node-Level Power Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13155v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for data center capacity, driven by the growth of high-performance computing, cloud computing, and especially artificial intelligence, has led to a sharp increase in data center energy consumption. To improve energy efficiency, gaining process-level insights into energy consumption is essential. While node-level energy consumption data can be directly measured with hardware such as power meters, existing mechanisms for estimating per-process energy usage, such as Intel RAPL, are limited to specific hardware and provide only coarse-grained, domain-level measurements. Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Multigrid with Adaptive Galerkin Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13109v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a robust, adaptive coarse-grid correction scheme for matrix-free geometric multigrid targeting PDEs with strongly varying coefficients. The method combines uniform geometric coarsening of the underlying grid with heterogeneous coarse-grid operators: Galerkin coarse grid approximation is applied locally in regions with large coefficient gradients, while lightweight, direct coarse grid approximation is used elsewhere. This selective application ensures that local Galerkin operators are computed and stored only where necessary, minimizing memory requirements while maintaining robust convergence. We demonstrate the method on a suite of sinker benchmark problems for the generalized Stokes equation, including grid-aligned and unaligned viscosity jumps, smoothly varying viscosity functions with large gradients, and different viscosity evaluation techniques. We analytically quantify the solver's memory consumption and demonstrate its efficiency by solving Stokes problems with $10^{10}$ degrees of freedom, viscosity jumps of $10^{6}$ magnitude, and more than 100{,}000 parallel processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MACKO: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication for Low Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13061v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in the inference of sparse Large Language Models (LLMs). Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + 7 pages appendix, 11 figures, Code available at https://github.com/vlejd/macko_spmv</p></details> |
| **[FlowLog: Efficient and Extensible Datalog via Incrementality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00865v4)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datalog-based languages are regaining popularity as a powerful abstraction for expressing recursive computations in domains such as program analysis and graph processing. However, existing systems often face a trade-off between efficiency and extensibility. Engines like Souffle achieve high efficiency through domain-specific designs, but lack general-purpose flexibility. Others, like RecStep, offer modularity by layering Datalog on traditional databases, but struggle to integrate Datalog-specific optimizations. This paper bridges this gap by presenting FlowLog, a new Datalog engine that uses an explicit relational IR per-rule to cleanly separate recursive control (e.g., semi-naive execution) from each rule's logical plan. This boundary lets us retain fine-grained, Datalog-aware optimizations at the logical layer, but also reuse off-the-shelf database primitives at execution. At the logical level (i.e. IR), we apply proven SQL optimizations, such as logic fusion and subplan reuse. To address high volatility in recursive workloads, we adopt a robustness-first approach that pairs a structural optimizer (avoiding worst-case joins) with sideways information passing (early filtering). Built atop Differential Dataflow--a mature framework for streaming analytics--FlowLog supports both batch and incremental Datalog and adds novel recursion-aware optimizations called Boolean (or algebraic) specialization. Our evaluation shows that FlowLog outperforms state-of-the-art Datalog engines and modern databases across a broad range of recursive workloads, achieving superior scalability while preserving a simple and extensible architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VLDB 2026</p></details> |
