| **[Graph Rewriting Language as a Platform for Quantum Diagrammatic Calculi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15581v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic discovery of optimization paths in quantum circuit simplification remains a challenge. Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

| **[Beluga: Block Synchronization for BFT Consensus Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15517v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern high-throughput BFT consensus protocols use streamlined push-pull mechanisms to disseminate blocks and keep happy-path performance optimal. Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tensor Compiler for Processing-In-Memory Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15503v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing-In-Memory (PIM) devices integrated with high-performance Host processors (e.g., GPUs) can accelerate memory-intensive kernels in Machine Learning (ML) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by leveraging high memory bandwidth at PIM cores. However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proving there is a leader without naming it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15491v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local certification is a mechanism for certifying to the nodes of a network that a certain property holds. In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates. Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants). A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $Θ(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Formal Verification of Secure Vehicle Software Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15479v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software governs most vehicle functions alongside enhanced connectivity, the need for secure software updates has become increasingly critical. Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures. Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report is a preprint of the article accepted for publication in Computer & Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[SpargeAttention: Accurate and Training-free Sparse Attention Accelerating Any Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18137v8)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.</p></details> | <details><summary>@inpr...</summary><p>@inproceedings{zhang2025spargeattn, title={Spargeattn: Accurate sparse attention accelerating any model inference}, author={Zhang, Jintao and Xiang, Chendong and Huang, Haofeng and Wei, Jia and Xi, Haocheng and Zhu, Jun and Chen, Jianfei}, booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)}, year={2025} }</p></details> |
| **[Constructive community race: full-density spiking neural network model drives neuromorphic computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21185v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The local circuitry of the mammalian brain is a focus of the search for generic computational principles because it is largely conserved across species and modalities. In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\,\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Soteria: Efficient Symbolic Execution as a Functional Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08729v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution (SE) tools often rely on intermediate languages (ILs) to support multiple programming languages, promising reusability and efficiency. In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08343v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FerranAgulloLopez/GPULLMAdapterOptimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in a computer science workshop</p></details> |
| **[When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimmit: Fast Finality with Even Faster Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving low-latency consensus in geographically distributed systems remains a key challenge for blockchain and distributed database applications. To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting). We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[MutDafny: A Mutation-Based Approach to Assess Dafny Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15403v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior. We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Sides of 36 Coins: Measuring Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Across Cryptocurrencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems, and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly. Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS 2026</p></details> |
| **[FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE</p></details> |  |
| **[BlueBottle: Fast and Robust Blockchains through Subsystem Specialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices. We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.</p></details> |  |

To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized. We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\ln{k} / \sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.</p></details> | 36 pages |

This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, nodes are assigned labels, called certificates, which are supposed to prove that the property holds. The nodes then communicate with their neighbors to verify the correctness of these certificates. Certifying that there is a unique leader in a network is one of the most classical problems in this setting. It is well-known that this can be done using certificates that encode node identifiers and distances in the graph. These require $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log D)$ bits respectively, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter. A matching lower bound is known in cycle graphs (where $n$ and $D$ are equal up to multiplicative constants). A recent line of work has shown that network structure greatly influences local certification. For example, certifying that a network does not contain triangles takes $Θ(n)$ bits in general graphs, but only $O(\log n)$ bits in graphs of bounded treewidth. This observation raises the question: Is it possible to achieve sublogarithmic leader certification in graph classes that do not contain cycle graphs? And since in that case we cannot write identifiers in a certificate, do we actually need identifiers at all in such topologies? [We answer these questions with results on small diameter graphs, chordal graphs, grids, and dense graphs. See full abstract in the paper.]</p></details> |  |

Software vulnerabilities can severely impact safety, the economy, and society. In response to this challenge, Strandberg et al. [escar Europe, 2021] introduced the Unified Software Update Framework (UniSUF), designed to provide a secure update framework that integrates seamlessly with existing vehicular infrastructures. Although UniSUF has previously been evaluated regarding cybersecurity, these assessments have not employed formal verification methods. To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report is a preprint of the article accepted for publication in Computer & Security 2025</p></details> |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.</p></details> | <details><summary>@inpr...</summary><p>@inproceedings{zhang2025spargeattn, title={Spargeattn: Accurate sparse attention accelerating any model inference}, author={Zhang, Jintao and Xiang, Chendong and Huang, Haofeng and Wei, Jia and Xi, Haocheng and Zhu, Jun and Chen, Jianfei}, booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)}, year={2025} }</p></details> |

In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\,\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |

Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.

Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimmit: Fast Finality with Even Faster Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving low-latency consensus in geographically distributed systems remains a key challenge for blockchain and distributed database applications. To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting). We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior. We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.</p></details> |  |

However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly. Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS 2026</p></details> |
| **[FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE</p></details> |  |
| **[BlueBottle: Fast and Robust Blockchains through Subsystem Specialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices. We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.</p></details> |  |

To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized. We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.</p></details> |  |

While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\ln{k} / \sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Today, ZX-calculus, a computing model for quantum circuit transformation, is attracting attention for its highly abstract graph-based approach. Whereas existing tools such as PyZX and Quantomatic offer domain-specific support for quantum circuit optimization, visualization and theorem-proving, we present a complementary approach using LMNtal, a general-purpose hierarchical graph rewriting language, to establish a diagrammatic transformation and verification platform with model checking. Our methodology shows three advantages: (1) manipulation of ZX-diagrams through native graph transformation rules, enabling direct implementation of basic rules; (2) quantified pattern matching via QLMNtal extensions, greatly simplifying rule specification; and (3) interactive visualization and validation of optimization paths through state space exploration. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our framework helps understand optimization paths and design new algorithms and strategies. This suggests that the declarative language LMNtal and its toolchain could serve as a new platform to investigate quantum circuit transformation from a different perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 27 figures.

Yet state-of-the-art designs lack a principled and efficient way to exchange blocks, which leaves them open to targeted attacks and performance collapse under network asynchrony. This work introduces the concept of a block synchronizer, a simple abstraction that drives incremental block retrieval and enforces resource-aware exchange. Its interface and role fit cleanly inside a modern BFT consensus stack. We also uncover a new attack, where an adversary steers honest validators into redundant, uncoordinated pulls that exhaust bandwidth and stall progress. Beluga is a modular and scarcity-aware instantiation of the block synchronizer. It achieves optimal common-case latency while bounding the cost of recovery under faults and adversarial behavior. We integrate Beluga into Mysticeti, the consensus core of the Sui blockchain, and show on a geo-distributed AWS deployment that Beluga sustains optimal performance in the optimistic path and, under attack, delivers up to 3x higher throughput and 25x lower latency than prior designs. The Sui blockchain adopted Beluga in production.</p></details> |  |

However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution. In end-to-end LLM inference, DCC on AttAcc accelerates GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 by up to 7.71x (4.88x average) over GPU.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we perform a formal security analysis of UniSUF. We model UniSUF's architecture and assumptions to reflect real-world automotive systems and develop a ProVerif-based framework that formally verifies UniSUF's compliance with essential security requirements - confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, freshness, order, and liveness - demonstrating their satisfiability through symbolic execution. Our results demonstrate that UniSUF adheres to the specified security guarantees, ensuring the correctness and reliability of its security framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report is a preprint of the article accepted for publication in Computer & Security 2025</p></details> |

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.</p></details> | <details><summary>@inpr...</summary><p>@inproceedings{zhang2025spargeattn, title={Spargeattn: Accurate sparse attention accelerating any model inference}, author={Zhang, Jintao and Xiang, Chendong and Huang, Haofeng and Wei, Jia and Xi, Haocheng and Zhu, Jun and Chen, Jianfei}, booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)}, year={2025} }</p></details> |

In 2014 a model was proposed representing all neurons and synapses of the stereotypical cortical microcircuit below $1\,\text{mm}^2$ of brain surface. The model reproduces fundamental features of brain activity but its impact remained limited because of its computational demands. For theory and simulation, however, the model was a breakthrough because it removes uncertainties of downscaling, and larger models are less densely connected. This sparked a race in the neuromorphic computing community and the model became a de facto standard benchmark. Within a few years real-time performance was reached and surpassed at significantly reduced energy consumption. We review how the computational challenge was tackled by different simulation technologies and derive guidelines for the next generation of benchmarks and other domains of science.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08343v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FerranAgulloLopez/GPULLMAdapterOptimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in a computer science workshop</p></details> |
| **[When Can You Trust Bitcoin? Value-Dependent Block Confirmation to Determine Transaction Finalit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15421v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study financial transaction confirmation finality in Bitcoin as a function of transaction amount and user risk tolerance. A transaction is recorded in a block on a blockchain. However, a transaction may be revoked due to a fork in the blockchain, the odds of which decrease over time but never reach zero. Therefore, a transaction is considered confirmed if its block is sufficiently deep in the blockchain. This depth is usually set empirically at some fixed number such as six blocks. We analyze forks under varying network delays in simulation and actual Bitcoin data. Based on this analysis, we establish a relationship between block depth and the probability of confirmation revocation due to a fork. We use prospect theory to relate transaction confirmation probability to transaction amount and user risk tolerance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimmit: Fast Finality with Even Faster Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10862v3)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving low-latency consensus in geographically distributed systems remains a key challenge for blockchain and distributed database applications. To this end, there has been significant recent interest in State-Machine-Replication (SMR) protocols that achieve 2-round finality under the assumption that $5f+1\leq n$, where $n$ is the number of processors and $f$ bounds the number of processors that may exhibit Byzantine faults. In these protocols, instructions are organised into views, each led by a different designated leader, and 2-round finality means that a leader's proposal can be finalised after just a single round of voting, meaning two rounds overall (one round for the proposal and one for voting). We introduce Minimmit, a Byzantine-fault-tolerant SMR protocol with lower latency than previous 2-round finality approaches. Our key insight is that view progression and transaction finality can operate on different quorum thresholds without compromising safety or liveness. Experiments simulating a globally distributed network of 50 processors, uniformly assigned across ten virtual regions, show that the approach leads to a 23.1% reduction in view latency and a 10.7% reduction in transaction latency compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[MutDafny: A Mutation-Based Approach to Assess Dafny Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15403v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the use of mutation testing to reveal weaknesses in formal specifications written in Dafny. In verification-aware programming languages, such as Dafny, despite their critical role, specifications are as prone to errors as implementations. Flaws in specs can result in formally verified programs that deviate from the intended behavior. We present MutDafny, a tool that increases the reliability of Dafny specifications by automatically signaling potential weaknesses. Using a mutation testing approach, we introduce faults (mutations) into the code and rely on formal specifications for detecting them. If a program with a mutant verifies, this may indicate a weakness in the specification. We extensively analyze mutation operators from popular tools, identifying the ones applicable to Dafny. In addition, we synthesize new operators tailored for Dafny from bugfix commits in publicly available Dafny projects on GitHub. Drawing from both, we equipped our tool with a total of 32 mutation operators. We evaluate MutDafny's effectiveness and efficiency in a dataset of 794 real-world Dafny programs and we manually analyze a subset of the resulting undetected mutants, identifying five weak real-world specifications (on average, one at every 241 lines of code) that would benefit from strengthening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Sides of 36 Coins: Measuring Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Across Cryptocurrencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15388v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain technologies underpin an expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications, financial systems, and infrastructure. However, the fundamental networking layer that sustains these systems, the peer-to-peer layer, of all but the top few ecosystems remains largely opaque. In this paper, we present the first longitudinal, cross-network measurement study of 36 public blockchain networks. Over 9 months, we deployed 15 active crawlers, sourced data from two additional community crawlers, and conducted hourly connectivity probes to observe the evolving state of these networks. Furthermore, by leveraging Ethereum's discovery protocols, we inferred metadata for an additional 19 auxiliary networks that utilize the Ethereum peer discovery protocol. We also explored Internet-wide scans, which only require probing each protocol's default ports with a simple, network-specific payload. This approach allows us to rapidly identify responsive peers across the entire address space without having to implement custom discovery and handshake logic for every blockchain. We validated this method on Bitcoin and similar networks with known ground truth, then applied it to Cardano, which we could not crawl directly. Our study uncovers dramatic variation in network size from under 10 to more than 10,000 active nodes. We quantify trends in IPv4 versus IPv6 usage, analyze autonomous systems and geographic concentration, and characterize churn, diurnal behavior, and the coverage and redundancy of discovery protocols. These findings expose critical differences in network resilience, decentralization, and observability. Beyond characterizing each network, our methodology demonstrates a general framework for measuring decentralized networks at scale. This opens the door for continued monitoring, benchmarking, and more transparent assessments of blockchain infrastructure across diverse ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of ACM SIGMETRICS 2026</p></details> |
| **[FLARE: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14715v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE</p></details> |  |
| **[BlueBottle: Fast and Robust Blockchains through Subsystem Specialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15361v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain consensus faces a trilemma of security, latency, and decentralization. High-throughput systems often require a reduction in decentralization or robustness against strong adversaries, while highly decentralized and secure systems tend to have lower performance. We present BlueBottle, a two-layer consensus architecture. The core layer, BB-Core, is an n=5f+1 protocol that trades some fault tolerance for a much lower finality latency with a medium-sized core validator set. Our experiments show that BB-Core reduces latency by 20-25% in comparison to Mysticeti. The guard layer, BB-Guard, provides decentralized timestamping, proactive misbehavior detection in BB-Core, and a synchronous recovery path. When it observes equivocations or liveness failures in the core -- while tolerating up to f<3n/5 faulty nodes in the primary layer -- guard validators disseminate evidence, agree on misbehaving parties for exclusion or slashing, and either restart the core protocol (for liveness violations) or select a canonical fork (for safety violations). Together, these layers enable optimistic sub-second finality at high throughput while maintaining strong safety and liveness under a mild synchrony assumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices. We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harli: SLO-Aware Co-location of LLM Inference and PEFT-based Finetuning on Model-as-a-Service Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11729v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed under the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized. We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving IoT in Connected Aircraft Cabin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15278v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of IoT devices in shared, multi-vendor environments like the modern aircraft cabin creates a fundamental conflict between the promise of data collaboration and the risks to passenger privacy, vendor intellectual property (IP), and regulatory compliance. While emerging standards like the Cabin Secure Media-Independent Messaging (CSMIM) protocol provide a secure communication backbone, they do not resolve data governance challenges at the application layer, leaving a privacy gap that impedes trust. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework that closes this gap by integrating a configurable layer of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) atop a CSMIM-like architecture. We conduct a rigorous, empirical analysis of two pragmatic PETs: Differential Privacy (DP) for statistical sharing, and an additive secret sharing scheme (ASS) for data obfuscation. Using a high-fidelity testbed with resource-constrained hardware, we quantify the trade-offs between data privacy, utility, and computing performance. Our results demonstrate that the computational overhead of PETs is often negligible compared to inherent network and protocol latencies. We prove that architectural choices, such as on-device versus virtualized processing, have a far greater impact on end-to-end latency and computational performance than the PETs themselves. The findings provide a practical roadmap for system architects to select and configure appropriate PETs, enabling the design of trustworthy collaborative IoT ecosystems in avionics and other critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Resource-Constrained Decentralized Federated Learning via Personalized Event-Triggering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12640v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a popular technique for distributing machine learning (ML) across a set of edge devices. In this paper, we study fully decentralized FL, where in addition to devices conducting training locally, they carry out model aggregations via cooperative consensus formation over device-to-device (D2D) networks. We introduce asynchronous, event-triggered communications among the devices to handle settings where access to a central server is not feasible. To account for the inherent resource heterogeneity and statistical diversity challenges in FL, we define personalized communication triggering conditions at each device that weigh the change in local model parameters against the available local network resources. We theoretically recover the $O(\ln{k} / \sqrt{k})$ convergence rate to the globally optimal model of decentralized gradient descent (DGD) methods in the setup of our methodology. We provide our convergence guarantees for the last iterates of models, under relaxed graph connectivity and data heterogeneity assumptions compared with the existing literature. To do so, we demonstrate a $B$-connected information flow guarantee in the presence of sporadic communications over the time-varying D2D graph. Our subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in convergence speed and/or communication savings compared to existing decentralized FL baselines.</p></details> | 36 pages |
