| **[Automating the Analysis of Parsing Algorithms (and other Dynamic Programs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23665v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much algorithmic research in NLP aims to efficiently manipulate rich formal structures. An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2021 ...</summary><p>2021 manuscript; accepted by TACL but not revised for publication</p></details> |
| **[Sedna: Sharding transactions in multiple concurrent proposer blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17045v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern blockchains increasingly adopt multi-proposer (MCP) consensus to remove single-leader bottlenecks and improve censorship resistance. However, MCP alone does not resolve how users should disseminate transactions to proposers. Today, users either naively replicate full transactions to many proposers, sacrificing goodput and exposing payloads to MEV, or target few proposers and accept weak censorship and latency guarantees. This yields a practical trilemma among censorship resistance, low latency, and reasonable cost (in fees or system goodput). We present Sedna, a user-facing protocol that replaces naive transaction replication with verifiable, rateless coding. Users privately deliver addressed symbol bundles to subsets of proposers; execution follows a deterministic order once enough symbols are finalized to decode. We prove Sedna guarantees liveness and \emph{until-decode privacy}, significantly reducing MEV exposure. Analytically, the protocol approaches the information-theoretic lower bound for bandwidth overhead, yielding a 2-3x efficiency improvement over naive replication. Sedna requires no consensus modifications, enabling incremental deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Per-Thread Lock Sets: Multi-Thread Critical Sections and Dynamic Deadlock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23552v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaptiFlow: An Extensible Framework for Event-Driven Autonomy in Cloud Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23499v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud architectures demand self-adaptive capabilities to manage dynamic operational conditions. Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service. Key innovations include a workflow for service instrumentation and evidence that decentralized adaptation can emerge from localized decisions without global coordination. The work bridges autonomic computing theory with cloud-native practice, providing both a conceptual framework and concrete tools for building resilient distributed systems. Future work includes integration with formal coordination models and application of adaptation techniques relying on AI agents for proactive adaptation to address complex adaptation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Adaptable TeaStore: A Choreographic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23497v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adaptable TeaStore has recently been proposed as a reference model for adaptable microservice architectures. It includes different configurations, as well as scenarios requiring to transition between them. We describe an implementation of the Adaptable TeaStore based on AIOCJ, a choreographic language that allows one to program multiparty systems that can adapt at runtime to different conditions. Following the choreographic tradition, AIOCJ ensures by-construction correctness of communications (e.g., no deadlocks) before, during, and after adaptation. Adaptation is dynamic, and the adaptation scenarios need to be fully specified only at runtime. Using AIOCJ to model the Adaptable TeaStore, we showcase the strengths of the approach and its current limitations, providing suggestions for future directions for refining the paradigm (and the AIOCJ language, in particular), to better align it with real-world Cloud architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Fancy Some Chips for Your TeaStore? Modeling the Control of an Adaptable Discrete System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23496v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks. Chips mixes notions from control theory and general purpose programming languages to generate robust component-based models. This paper presents how to use Chips to systematically design, model and analyse a complex system project, using a variation of the Adaptable TeaStore application as running example.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054.

| **[Decoupling Adaptive Control in TeaStore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23495v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adaptable TeaStore specification provides a microservice-based case study for implementing self-adaptation through a control loop. We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met), and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic). In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Configuration of API Resources in Cloud Native Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23494v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible. If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Adaptable TeaStore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16060v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud-native systems require adapting dynamically to changing operational conditions, including service outages, traffic surges, and evolving user requirements. While existing benchmarks provide valuable testbeds for performance and scalability evaluation, they lack explicit support for studying adaptation mechanisms, reconfiguration strategies, and graceful degradation. These limitations hinder systematic research on self-adaptive architectures in realistic cloud environments. To cover this gap, we introduce Adaptable TeaStore, an extension of the renowned TeaStore architecture that incorporates adaptability as a first-class design concern. Our extension distinguishes between mandatory and optional services, supports multiple component versions -- with varying resource requirements and functionality levels -- considers the outsourcing of functionalities to external providers, and provides local cache mechanisms for performance and resilience. These features enable the systematic exploration of reconfiguration policies across diverse operational scenarios. We discuss a broad catalogue of reference adaptation scenarios centred around Adaptable TeaStore, useful to evaluate the ability of a given adaptation technology to address conditions such as component unavailability, cyberattacks, provider outages, benign/malicious traffic increases, and user-triggered reconfigurations. Moreover, we present an open-source implementation of the architecture with APIs for metrics collection and adaptation triggers, to enable reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15965v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving $1.07\times-2.43\times$ speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf</p></details> |
| **[Bitcoin-IPC: Scaling Bitcoin with a Network of Proof-of-Stake Subnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23439v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Bitcoin-IPC, a software stack and protocol that scales Bitcoin towards helping it become the universal Medium of Exchange (MoE) by enabling the permissionless creation of fully programmable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-2 chains, called subnets, whose stake is denominated in L1 BTC. Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security. Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Local Rendezvous Hashing: Bounded Loads and Minimal Churn via Cache-Local Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23434v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures.

| **[An SLO Driven and Cost-Aware Autoscaling Framework for Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23415v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kubernetes provides native autoscaling mechanisms, including the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and node-level autoscalers, to enable elastic resource management for cloud-native applications. However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapunSL: Untangling Quantum Computing with Separation, Linear Combination and Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23472v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the conference paper at POPL 2026.

| **[Parameter-Efficient and Personalized Federated Training of Generative Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11585v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Splitwise: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Inference for LLMs via Lyapunov-Assisted DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23310v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairGFL: Privacy-Preserving Fairness-Aware Federated Learning with Overlapping Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23235v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anka: A Domain-Specific Language for Reliable LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23214v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables.

Sedna requires no consensus modifications, enabling incremental deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Per-Thread Lock Sets: Multi-Thread Critical Sections and Dynamic Deadlock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23552v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> |  |

The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service. Key innovations include a workflow for service instrumentation and evidence that decentralized adaptation can emerge from localized decisions without global coordination. The work bridges autonomic computing theory with cloud-native practice, providing both a conceptual framework and concrete tools for building resilient distributed systems. Future work includes integration with formal coordination models and application of adaptation techniques relying on AI agents for proactive adaptation to address complex adaptation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Adaptable TeaStore: A Choreographic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23497v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adaptable TeaStore has recently been proposed as a reference model for adaptable microservice architectures. It includes different configurations, as well as scenarios requiring to transition between them. We describe an implementation of the Adaptable TeaStore based on AIOCJ, a choreographic language that allows one to program multiparty systems that can adapt at runtime to different conditions. Following the choreographic tradition, AIOCJ ensures by-construction correctness of communications (e.g., no deadlocks) before, during, and after adaptation. Adaptation is dynamic, and the adaptation scenarios need to be fully specified only at runtime. Using AIOCJ to model the Adaptable TeaStore, we showcase the strengths of the approach and its current limitations, providing suggestions for future directions for refining the paradigm (and the AIOCJ language, in particular), to better align it with real-world Cloud architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |

Modeling the Control of an Adaptable Discrete System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23496v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks. Chips mixes notions from control theory and general purpose programming languages to generate robust component-based models. This paper presents how to use Chips to systematically design, model and analyse a complex system project, using a variation of the Adaptable TeaStore application as running example.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054.

| **[Decoupling Adaptive Control in TeaStore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23495v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Adaptable TeaStore specification provides a microservice-based case study for implementing self-adaptation through a control loop. We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met), and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic). In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Configuration of API Resources in Cloud Native Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23494v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible. If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Adaptable TeaStore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16060v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud-native systems require adapting dynamically to changing operational conditions, including service outages, traffic surges, and evolving user requirements. While existing benchmarks provide valuable testbeds for performance and scalability evaluation, they lack explicit support for studying adaptation mechanisms, reconfiguration strategies, and graceful degradation. These limitations hinder systematic research on self-adaptive architectures in realistic cloud environments. To cover this gap, we introduce Adaptable TeaStore, an extension of the renowned TeaStore architecture that incorporates adaptability as a first-class design concern. Our extension distinguishes between mandatory and optional services, supports multiple component versions -- with varying resource requirements and functionality levels -- considers the outsourcing of functionalities to external providers, and provides local cache mechanisms for performance and resilience. These features enable the systematic exploration of reconfiguration policies across diverse operational scenarios. We discuss a broad catalogue of reference adaptation scenarios centred around Adaptable TeaStore, useful to evaluate the ability of a given adaptation technology to address conditions such as component unavailability, cyberattacks, provider outages, benign/malicious traffic increases, and user-triggered reconfigurations. Moreover, we present an open-source implementation of the architecture with APIs for metrics collection and adaptation triggers, to enable reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |

However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving $1.07\times-2.43\times$ speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf</p></details> |

Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security. Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Local Rendezvous Hashing: Bounded Loads and Minimal Churn via Cache-Local Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23434v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures.

| **[An SLO Driven and Cost-Aware Autoscaling Framework for Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23415v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kubernetes provides native autoscaling mechanisms, including the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and node-level autoscalers, to enable elastic resource management for cloud-native applications. However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.</p></details> |  |

In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the conference paper at POPL 2026.

We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anka: A Domain-Specific Language for Reliable LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23214v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables.

An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2021 ...</summary><p>2021 manuscript; accepted by TACL but not revised for publication</p></details> |

However, MCP alone does not resolve how users should disseminate transactions to proposers. Today, users either naively replicate full transactions to many proposers, sacrificing goodput and exposing payloads to MEV, or target few proposers and accept weak censorship and latency guarantees. This yields a practical trilemma among censorship resistance, low latency, and reasonable cost (in fees or system goodput). We present Sedna, a user-facing protocol that replaces naive transaction replication with verifiable, rateless coding. Users privately deliver addressed symbol bundles to subsets of proposers; execution follows a deterministic order once enough symbols are finalized to decode. We prove Sedna guarantees liveness and \emph{until-decode privacy}, significantly reducing MEV exposure. Analytically, the protocol approaches the information-theoretic lower bound for bandwidth overhead, yielding a 2-3x efficiency improvement over naive replication. Sedna requires no consensus modifications, enabling incremental deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Per-Thread Lock Sets: Multi-Thread Critical Sections and Dynamic Deadlock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23552v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability.

Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Configuration of API Resources in Cloud Native Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23494v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible. If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[Adaptable TeaStore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16060v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cloud-native systems require adapting dynamically to changing operational conditions, including service outages, traffic surges, and evolving user requirements. While existing benchmarks provide valuable testbeds for performance and scalability evaluation, they lack explicit support for studying adaptation mechanisms, reconfiguration strategies, and graceful degradation. These limitations hinder systematic research on self-adaptive architectures in realistic cloud environments. To cover this gap, we introduce Adaptable TeaStore, an extension of the renowned TeaStore architecture that incorporates adaptability as a first-class design concern. Our extension distinguishes between mandatory and optional services, supports multiple component versions -- with varying resource requirements and functionality levels -- considers the outsourcing of functionalities to external providers, and provides local cache mechanisms for performance and resilience. These features enable the systematic exploration of reconfiguration policies across diverse operational scenarios. We discuss a broad catalogue of reference adaptation scenarios centred around Adaptable TeaStore, useful to evaluate the ability of a given adaptation technology to address conditions such as component unavailability, cyberattacks, provider outages, benign/malicious traffic increases, and user-triggered reconfigurations. Moreover, we present an open-source implementation of the architecture with APIs for metrics collection and adaptation triggers, to enable reproducible experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings WACA 2025, arXiv:2512.22054</p></details> |
| **[RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15965v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving $1.07\times-2.43\times$ speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf</p></details> |

Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security. Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Local Rendezvous Hashing: Bounded Loads and Minimal Churn via Cache-Local Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23434v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697). A microbenchmark indicates multi-probe assignment is dominated by repeated ring searches and memory traffic rather than probe-generation arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures.

| **[An SLO Driven and Cost-Aware Autoscaling Framework for Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23415v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kubernetes provides native autoscaling mechanisms, including the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, Vertical Pod Autoscaler, and node-level autoscalers, to enable elastic resource management for cloud-native applications. However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[RapunSL: Untangling Quantum Computing with Separation, Linear Combination and Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23472v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the conference paper at POPL 2026.

| **[Parameter-Efficient and Personalized Federated Training of Generative Models at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11585v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Splitwise: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Inference for LLMs via Lyapunov-Assisted DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23310v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[FairGFL: Privacy-Preserving Fairness-Aware Federated Learning with Overlapping Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23235v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anka: A Domain-Specific Language for Reliable LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23214v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables.
