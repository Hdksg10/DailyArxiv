| **[sVIRGO: A Scalable Virtual Tree Hierarchical Framework for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02438v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose sVIRGO, a scalable virtual tree hierarchical framework for large-scale distributed systems. sVIRGO constructs virtual hierarchical trees directly on physical nodes, allowing each node to assume multiple hierarchical roles without overlay networks. The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer. Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions. Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions. sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Beyond Per-Thread Lock Sets: Multi-Thread Critical Sections and Dynamic Deadlock Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23552v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typo in Fig 3 (x => l1, y => l2)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Federated Learning with SignSGD: A Highly Communication-Efficient Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02355v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.</p></details> |  |
| **[LCLs Beyond Bounded Degrees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02340v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees. We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$. Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees. Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or - $O(\log n)$. Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$.</p></details> |  |

Data Contracts, Versioning, and Transactional Pipelines for Humans and Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02335v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lakehouses are the default cloud platform for analytics and AI, but they become unsafe when untrusted actors concurrently operate on production data: upstream-downstream mismatches surface only at runtime, and multi-table pipelines can leak partial effects. Inspired by software engineering, we design Bauplan, a code-first lakehouse that aims to make (most) illegal states unrepresentable using familiar abstractions. Bauplan acts along three axes: typed table contracts to make pipeline boundaries checkable, Git-like data versioning for review and reproducibility, and transactional runs that guarantee pipeline-level atomicity. We report early results from a lightweight formal transaction model and discuss future work motivated by counterexamples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print (PaPoC 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Enabling AI Deep Potentials for Ab Initio-quality Molecular Dynamics Simulations in GROMACS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02234v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art AI deep potentials provide ab initio-quality results, but at a fraction of the computational cost of first-principles quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory. In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Extreme Data Scarcity by Explicit Physics Integration: An Application to Groundwater Heat Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06062v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world flow applications in complex scientific and engineering domains, such as geosciences, challenge classical simulation methods due to large spatial domains, high spatio-temporal resolution requirements, and potentially strong material heterogeneities that lead to ill-conditioning and long runtimes. While machine learning-based surrogate models can reduce computational cost, they typically rely on large training datasets that are often unavailable in practice. To address data-scarce settings, we revisit the structure of advection-diffusion problems and decompose them into multiscale processes of locally and globally dominated components, separating spatially localized interactions and long-range effects. We propose a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) that combines a lightweight numerical model for global transport with two convolutional neural networks addressing processes of a more local nature. We demonstrate the performance of our method on city-scale geothermal heat pump interaction modeling and show that, even when trained on fewer than five simulations, LGCNN generalizes to arbitrarily larger domains, and can be successfully transferred to real subsurface parameter maps from the Munich region, Germany.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ECHO-2: A Large Scale Distributed Rollout Framework for Cost-efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02192v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical stage in post-training large language models (LLMs), involving repeated interaction between rollout generation, reward evaluation, and centralized learning. Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TriCloudEdge: A multi-layer Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02121v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Latency-Constrained, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Implementation in the Versal AI Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15626v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the use of the AMD Xilinx Versal Adaptable Intelligent Engine (AIE) to accelerate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) inference for latency constrained applications. We present a custom workload distribution framework across the AIE's vector processors and propose a hybrid AIE - Programmable Logic (PL) design to optimize computational efficiency. Our approach explores the parallelization over the rows of the matrices by utilizing as many of the AIE vectorized processors effectively computing all the elements of the resulting vector at the same time, an alternative to cascade stream pipelining.</p></details> |  |
| **[COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01935v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUPareto: Bridging the Forgetting-Utility Gap in Federated Unlearning via Pareto Augmented Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01852v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.</p></details> |  |

Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ZO-FL methods largely overlook curvature information, despite its well-established benefits for convergence acceleration. To address this, we propose HiSo, a Hessian-informed ZO federated optimization method that accelerates convergence by leveraging global diagonal Hessian approximations, while strictly preserving scalar-only communication without transmitting any second-order information. Theoretically, for non-convex functions, we show that HiSo can achieve an accelerated convergence rate that is independent of the Lipschitz constant $L$ and model dimension $d$ under some Hessian approximation assumptions, offering a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon of ZO convergence being much faster than its worst-case $\mathscr{O}(d)$-bound. Empirically, across diverse LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, HiSo delivers a 1$\sim$5$\times$ speedup in communication rounds over existing state-of-the-art ZO-FL baselines. This superior convergence not only cuts communication costs but also provides strong empirical evidence that Hessian information acts as an effective accelerator in federated ZO optimization settings.

The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer. Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions. Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions. sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typo in Fig 3 (x => l1, y => l2)</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Federated Learning with SignSGD: A Highly Communication-Efficient Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02355v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has emerged as a key architecture for large-scale wireless and Internet of Things systems, where devices communicate with nearby edge servers before reaching the cloud. In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.</p></details> |  |

A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees. We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$. Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees. Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or - $O(\log n)$. Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we bring AI deep potentials into GROMACS, a production-level Molecular Dynamics (MD) code, by integrating with DeePMD-kit that provides domain-specific deep learning (DL) models of interatomic potential energy and force fields. In particular, we enable AI deep potentials inference across multiple DP model families and DL backends by coupling GROMACS Neural Network Potentials with the C++/CUDA backend in DeePMD-kit. We evaluate two recent large-atom-model architectures, DPA2 that is based on the attention mechanism and DPA3 that is based on GNN, in GROMACS using four ab initio-quality protein-in-water benchmarks (1YRF, 1UBQ, 3LZM, 2PTC) on NVIDIA A100 and GH200 GPUs. Our results show that DPA2 delivers up to 4.23x and 3.18x higher throughput than DPA3 on A100 and GH200 GPUs, respectively. We also provide a characterization study to further contrast DPA2 and DPA3 in throughput, memory usage, and kernel-level execution on GPUs. Our findings identify kernel-launch overhead and domain-decomposed inference as the main optimization priorities for AI deep potentials in production MD simulations.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning-based surrogate models can reduce computational cost, they typically rely on large training datasets that are often unavailable in practice. To address data-scarce settings, we revisit the structure of advection-diffusion problems and decompose them into multiscale processes of locally and globally dominated components, separating spatially localized interactions and long-range effects. We propose a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) that combines a lightweight numerical model for global transport with two convolutional neural networks addressing processes of a more local nature. We demonstrate the performance of our method on city-scale geothermal heat pump interaction modeling and show that, even when trained on fewer than five simulations, LGCNN generalizes to arbitrarily larger domains, and can be successfully transferred to real subsurface parameter maps from the Munich region, Germany.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach explores the parallelization over the rows of the matrices by utilizing as many of the AIE vectorized processors effectively computing all the elements of the resulting vector at the same time, an alternative to cascade stream pipelining.</p></details> |  |
| **[COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01935v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUPareto: Bridging the Forgetting-Utility Gap in Federated Unlearning via Pareto Augmented Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01852v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.</p></details> |  |

Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain.</p></details> |  |

However, existing ZO-FL methods largely overlook curvature information, despite its well-established benefits for convergence acceleration. To address this, we propose HiSo, a Hessian-informed ZO federated optimization method that accelerates convergence by leveraging global diagonal Hessian approximations, while strictly preserving scalar-only communication without transmitting any second-order information. Theoretically, for non-convex functions, we show that HiSo can achieve an accelerated convergence rate that is independent of the Lipschitz constant $L$ and model dimension $d$ under some Hessian approximation assumptions, offering a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon of ZO convergence being much faster than its worst-case $\mathscr{O}(d)$-bound. Empirically, across diverse LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, HiSo delivers a 1$\sim$5$\times$ speedup in communication rounds over existing state-of-the-art ZO-FL baselines. This superior convergence not only cuts communication costs but also provides strong empirical evidence that Hessian information acts as an effective accelerator in federated ZO optimization settings.

The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer. Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions. Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions. sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typo in Fig 3 (x => l1, y => l2)</p></details> |

In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification.</p></details> |  |
| **[LCLs Beyond Bounded Degrees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02340v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees. We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \mid k \in \mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$. Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees. Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \geq 1$, or - $O(\log n)$. Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning-based surrogate models can reduce computational cost, they typically rely on large training datasets that are often unavailable in practice. To address data-scarce settings, we revisit the structure of advection-diffusion problems and decompose them into multiscale processes of locally and globally dominated components, separating spatially localized interactions and long-range effects. We propose a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN) that combines a lightweight numerical model for global transport with two convolutional neural networks addressing processes of a more local nature. We demonstrate the performance of our method on city-scale geothermal heat pump interaction modeling and show that, even when trained on fewer than five simulations, LGCNN generalizes to arbitrarily larger domains, and can be successfully transferred to real subsurface parameter maps from the Munich region, Germany.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TriCloudEdge: A multi-layer Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02121v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TriCloudEdge is a scalable three-tier cloud continuum that integrates far-edge devices, intermediate edge nodes, and central cloud services, working in parallel as a unified solution. At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

We present a custom workload distribution framework across the AIE's vector processors and propose a hybrid AIE - Programmable Logic (PL) design to optimize computational efficiency. Our approach explores the parallelization over the rows of the matrices by utilizing as many of the AIE vectorized processors effectively computing all the elements of the resulting vector at the same time, an alternative to cascade stream pipelining.</p></details> |  |
| **[COLT: Lightweight Multi-LLM Collaboration through Shared MCTS Reasoning for Model Compilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01935v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Hierarchical Machine Learning for Joint Resource Allocation and Slice Selection in In-Network Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13313v3)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse promises immersive, real-time experiences; however, meeting its stringent latency and resource demands remains a major challenge. Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes). Compared with baseline models, DeepSets-S consistently achieves higher cost ratios and better utilization across COIN/MEC resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVERY: Adaptive VLM Split Computing through Embodied Self-Awareness for Efficient Disaster Response Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18151v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in disaster response require complex, queryable intelligence that on-board CNNs cannot provide. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer this semantic reasoning, their high resource demands make on-device deployment infeasible, and naive cloud offloading fails under the low-bandwidth networks common in disaster zones. We present AVERY, a framework that enables VLM deployment through adaptive split computing. We advance the split computing paradigm beyond traditional depth-wise partitioning by introducing a functional, cognitive-inspired dual-stream split that separates the VLM into a high-frequency, low-resolution "context stream" for real-time awareness and a low-frequency, high-fidelity "insight stream" for deep analysis. A lightweight, self-aware on-board controller manages this architecture, monitoring network conditions and operator intent to dynamically select from pre-trained compression models, navigating the fundamental accuracy-throughput trade-off. Evaluated using the VLM LISA-7B across an edge-cloud scenario under fluctuating network conditions, AVERY consistently outperforms static configurations, achieving 11.2% higher accuracy than raw image compression and 93.98% lower energy consumption compared to full-edge execution, thereby enhancing mission efficiency and enabling real-time, queryable intelligence on resource-constrained platforms in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Grappa: Gradient-Only Communication for Scalable Graph Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01872v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching.</p></details> |  |
| **[FUPareto: Bridging the Forgetting-Utility Gap in Federated Unlearning via Pareto Augmented Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01852v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.</p></details> |  |

Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain.</p></details> |  |

Main result is an algorithm that terminates with valid vector agreement, hence operates with safety, liveness, and tolerance to one crash. Reconciling with the FLP impossibility result, we identified: i) existence of two types of agreements: data-independent and data-dependent; and ii) dependence of FLP theorem correctness on three implicit assumptions. Consensus impossibility with data-dependent agreement is contingent on two of them. The theorem-stated impossibility with every agreement type hinges entirely on the third. We provide experimental results showing that the third assumption has no evidence in support.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis Group in the International Journal of Parallel, Emergent & Distributed Systems on 31/01/2026, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/17445760.2026.2621249</p></details> |
| **[Converge Faster, Talk Less: Hessian-Informed Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02370v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization enables dimension-free communication in federated learning (FL), making it attractive for fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) due to significant communication savings. However, existing ZO-FL methods largely overlook curvature information, despite its well-established benefits for convergence acceleration. To address this, we propose HiSo, a Hessian-informed ZO federated optimization method that accelerates convergence by leveraging global diagonal Hessian approximations, while strictly preserving scalar-only communication without transmitting any second-order information. Theoretically, for non-convex functions, we show that HiSo can achieve an accelerated convergence rate that is independent of the Lipschitz constant $L$ and model dimension $d$ under some Hessian approximation assumptions, offering a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon of ZO convergence being much faster than its worst-case $\mathscr{O}(d)$-bound. Empirically, across diverse LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, HiSo delivers a 1$\sim$5$\times$ speedup in communication rounds over existing state-of-the-art ZO-FL baselines. This superior convergence not only cuts communication costs but also provides strong empirical evidence that Hessian information acts as an effective accelerator in federated ZO optimization settings.
