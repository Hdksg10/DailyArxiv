| **[A Federated and Parameter-Efficient Framework for Large Language Model Training in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22124v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Convex Hull 3D Filtering with GPU Ray Tracing and Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19647v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, applications such as real-time simulations, autonomous systems, and video games increasingly demand the processing of complex geometric models under stringent time constraints. Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to 200x with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Do the Joules Go? Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The ML.ENERGY Leaderboard v3.0 is open https://ml.energy/leaderboard</p></details> |
| **[Heterogeneous Computing: The Key to Powering the Future of AI Agent Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22001v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cutting Quantum Circuits Beyond Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02064v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend quantum circuit cutting to heterogeneous registers comprising mixed-dimensional qudits. By decomposing non-local interactions into tensor products of local generalised Gell-Mann matrices, we enable the simulation and execution of high-dimensional circuits on disconnected hardware fragments. We validate this framework on qubit--qutrit ($2$--$3$) interfaces, achieving exact state reconstruction with a Total Variation Distance of 0 within single-precision floating-point tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the memory advantage in an 8-particle, dimension-8 system, reducing memory usage from 128 MB to 64 KB per circuit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL/releases/tag/v1.3.2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief Propagation Converges to Gaussian Distributions in Sparsely-Connected Factor Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21935v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Speeding up Local Optimization in Vehicle Routing with Tensor-based GPU Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17357v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming, especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method, providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Adaptive Probabilistic Skyline Query Processing in Distributed Edge Computing via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21855v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Software Pipelining using an SMT-Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21842v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization. To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks. Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

| **[EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

| **[bigMICE: Multiple Imputation of Big Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21613v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations. To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops. The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleSim: Serving Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulation with Invocation Distance-Based Memory Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21473v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nimbus: A Unified Embodied Synthetic Data Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21449v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-pronged deep learning preprocessing on heterogeneous platforms with CPU, Accelerator and CSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00005v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For image-related deep learning tasks, the first step often involves reading data from external storage and performing preprocessing on the CPU. As accelerator speed increases and the number of single compute node accelerators increases, the computing and data transfer capabilities gap between accelerators and CPUs gradually increases. Data reading and preprocessing become progressively the bottleneck of these tasks. Our work, DDLP, addresses the data computing and transfer bottleneck of deep learning preprocessing using Computable Storage Devices (CSDs). DDLP allows the CPU and CSD to efficiently parallelize preprocessing from both ends of the datasets, respectively. To this end, we propose two adaptive dynamic selection strategies to make DDLP control the accelerator to automatically read data from different sources. The two strategies trade-off between consistency and efficiency. DDLP achieves sufficient computational overlap between CSD data preprocessing and CPU preprocessing, accelerator computation, and accelerator data reading. In addition, DDLP leverages direct storage technology to enable efficient SSD-to-accelerator data transfer. In addition, DDLP reduces the use of expensive CPU and DRAM resources with more energy-efficient CSDs, alleviating preprocessing bottlenecks while significantly reducing power consumption. Extensive experimental results show that DDLP can improve learning speed by up to 23.5% on ImageNet Dataset while reducing energy consumption by 19.7% and CPU and DRAM usage by 37.6%. DDLP also improves the learning speed by up to 27.6% on the Cifar-10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS (TC)</p></details> |
| **[HybridFlow: Resource-Adaptive Subtask Routing for Efficient Edge-Cloud LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22137v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge-cloud collaborative inference is becoming a practical necessity for LLM-powered edge devices: on-device models often cannot afford the required reasoning capability, while cloud-only inference could be prohibitively costly and slow under strict latency and token/API budgets. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods often route per query or fixed steps simply based-on the estimated difficulty. Such coarse and static heuristics overlook subtask dependencies, missing opportunities for parallel execution and budget-adaptive routing. To this end, we propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a resource-adaptive edge-cloud inference framework that (i) builds a dependency-aware DAG for each query and executes newly unlocked subtasks in parallel, reducing end-to-end latency; (ii) routes each subtask online to the edge or cloud via a learned benefit--cost utility model that dynamically trades accuracy gains against token/API and latency budgets, thereby reducing unnecessary cloud usage while preserving reasoning quality. Across GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME24, and LiveBench-Reasoning, HybridFlow improves the cost-accuracy trade-off, reducing latency and cloud API usage while maintaining competitive accuracy against strong structured reasoning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient entanglement distribution is a cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that automatically optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the goodput, i.e., the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocols (BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results show that our approach mitigates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and reduces resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, and evaluate it for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous-variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, showing decision latencies in the millisecond range per link in our implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Native LLM and MLLM Inference at Scale on Apple Silicon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19139v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models, leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21\% to 87\% higher throughput than llama-cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Nonparametric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07132v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026; 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

| **[Learning Decentralized LLM Collaboration with Multi-Agent Actor Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21972v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, neighborhood exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming, especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method, providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> |

| **[DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization. To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks. Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

| **[EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations. To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops. The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.</p></details> |  |

Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-pronged deep learning preprocessing on heterogeneous platforms with CPU, Accelerator and CSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00005v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For image-related deep learning tasks, the first step often involves reading data from external storage and performing preprocessing on the CPU. As accelerator speed increases and the number of single compute node accelerators increases, the computing and data transfer capabilities gap between accelerators and CPUs gradually increases. Data reading and preprocessing become progressively the bottleneck of these tasks. Our work, DDLP, addresses the data computing and transfer bottleneck of deep learning preprocessing using Computable Storage Devices (CSDs). DDLP allows the CPU and CSD to efficiently parallelize preprocessing from both ends of the datasets, respectively. To this end, we propose two adaptive dynamic selection strategies to make DDLP control the accelerator to automatically read data from different sources. The two strategies trade-off between consistency and efficiency. DDLP achieves sufficient computational overlap between CSD data preprocessing and CPU preprocessing, accelerator computation, and accelerator data reading. In addition, DDLP leverages direct storage technology to enable efficient SSD-to-accelerator data transfer. In addition, DDLP reduces the use of expensive CPU and DRAM resources with more energy-efficient CSDs, alleviating preprocessing bottlenecks while significantly reducing power consumption. Extensive experimental results show that DDLP can improve learning speed by up to 23.5% on ImageNet Dataset while reducing energy consumption by 19.7% and CPU and DRAM usage by 37.6%. DDLP also improves the learning speed by up to 27.6% on the Cifar-10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS (TC)</p></details> |

However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods often route per query or fixed steps simply based-on the estimated difficulty. Such coarse and static heuristics overlook subtask dependencies, missing opportunities for parallel execution and budget-adaptive routing. To this end, we propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a resource-adaptive edge-cloud inference framework that (i) builds a dependency-aware DAG for each query and executes newly unlocked subtasks in parallel, reducing end-to-end latency; (ii) routes each subtask online to the edge or cloud via a learned benefit--cost utility model that dynamically trades accuracy gains against token/API and latency budgets, thereby reducing unnecessary cloud usage while preserving reasoning quality. Across GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME24, and LiveBench-Reasoning, HybridFlow improves the cost-accuracy trade-off, reducing latency and cloud API usage while maintaining competitive accuracy against strong structured reasoning baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that automatically optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the goodput, i.e., the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocols (BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results show that our approach mitigates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and reduces resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, and evaluate it for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous-variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, showing decision latencies in the millisecond range per link in our implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models, leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21\% to 87\% higher throughput than llama-cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026; 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to 200x with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The ML.ENERGY Leaderboard v3.0 is open https://ml.energy/leaderboard</p></details> |

We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Software Pipelining using an SMT-Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21842v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[DASH: Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-throughput Reproducible LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21824v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determinism is indispensable for reproducibility in large language model (LLM) training, yet it often exacts a steep performance cost. In widely used attention implementations such as FlashAttention-3, the deterministic backward pass can incur up to a 37.9% throughput reduction relative to its non-deterministic counterpart, primarily because gradient accumulation operations must be serialized to guarantee numerical consistency. This performance loss stems from suboptimal scheduling of compute and gradient-reduction phases, leading to significant hardware underutilization. To address this challenge, we formulate the backward pass of deterministic attention as a scheduling problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and derive schedules that minimize the critical path length. Building on this formulation, we present DASH (Deterministic Attention Scheduling for High-Throughput), which encapsulates two complementary scheduling strategies: (i) Descending Q-Tile Iteration, a reversed query-block traversal that shrinks pipeline stalls in causal attention, and (ii) Shift Scheduling, a theoretically optimal schedule within our DAG model that reduces pipeline stalls for both full and causal masks. Our empirical evaluations on NVIDIA H800 GPUs demonstrate that DASH narrows the performance gap of deterministic attention. The proposed strategies improve the throughput of the attention backward pass by up to 1.28$\times$ compared to the baseline, significantly advancing the efficiency of reproducible LLM training.

| **[EWSJF: An Adaptive Scheduler with Hybrid Partitioning for Mixed-Workload LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21758v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

| **[bigMICE: Multiple Imputation of Big Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21613v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data is a prevalent issue in many applications, including large medical registries such as the Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries, potentially leading to biased or inefficient analyses if not handled properly. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a popular and versatile method for handling multivariate missing data but traditional implementations face significant challenges when applied to big data sets due to computational time and memory limitations. To address this, the bigMICE package was developed, adapting the MICE framework to big data using Apache Spark MLLib and Spark ML. Our implementation allows for controlling the maximum memory usage during the execution, enabling processing of very large data sets on a hardware with a limited memory, such as ordinary laptops. The developed package was tested on a large Swedish medical registry to measure memory usage, runtime and dependence of the imputation quality on sample size and on missingness proportion in the data. In conclusion, our method is generally more memory efficient and faster on large data sets compared to a commonly used MICE implementation. We also demonstrate that working with very large datasets can result in high quality imputations even when a variable has a large proportion of missing data. This paper also provides guidelines and recommendations on how to install and use our open source package.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleSim: Serving Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulation with Invocation Distance-Based Memory Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21473v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nimbus: A Unified Embodied Synthetic Data Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21449v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-pronged deep learning preprocessing on heterogeneous platforms with CPU, Accelerator and CSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00005v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For image-related deep learning tasks, the first step often involves reading data from external storage and performing preprocessing on the CPU. As accelerator speed increases and the number of single compute node accelerators increases, the computing and data transfer capabilities gap between accelerators and CPUs gradually increases. Data reading and preprocessing become progressively the bottleneck of these tasks. Our work, DDLP, addresses the data computing and transfer bottleneck of deep learning preprocessing using Computable Storage Devices (CSDs). DDLP allows the CPU and CSD to efficiently parallelize preprocessing from both ends of the datasets, respectively. To this end, we propose two adaptive dynamic selection strategies to make DDLP control the accelerator to automatically read data from different sources. The two strategies trade-off between consistency and efficiency. DDLP achieves sufficient computational overlap between CSD data preprocessing and CPU preprocessing, accelerator computation, and accelerator data reading. In addition, DDLP leverages direct storage technology to enable efficient SSD-to-accelerator data transfer. In addition, DDLP reduces the use of expensive CPU and DRAM resources with more energy-efficient CSDs, alleviating preprocessing bottlenecks while significantly reducing power consumption. Extensive experimental results show that DDLP can improve learning speed by up to 23.5% on ImageNet Dataset while reducing energy consumption by 19.7% and CPU and DRAM usage by 37.6%. DDLP also improves the learning speed by up to 27.6% on the Cifar-10 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS (TC)</p></details> |
| **[HybridFlow: Resource-Adaptive Subtask Routing for Efficient Edge-Cloud LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22137v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge-cloud collaborative inference is becoming a practical necessity for LLM-powered edge devices: on-device models often cannot afford the required reasoning capability, while cloud-only inference could be prohibitively costly and slow under strict latency and token/API budgets. However, existing edge-cloud collaboration methods often route per query or fixed steps simply based-on the estimated difficulty. Such coarse and static heuristics overlook subtask dependencies, missing opportunities for parallel execution and budget-adaptive routing. To this end, we propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a resource-adaptive edge-cloud inference framework that (i) builds a dependency-aware DAG for each query and executes newly unlocked subtasks in parallel, reducing end-to-end latency; (ii) routes each subtask online to the edge or cloud via a learned benefit--cost utility model that dynamically trades accuracy gains against token/API and latency budgets, thereby reducing unnecessary cloud usage while preserving reasoning quality. Across GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME24, and LiveBench-Reasoning, HybridFlow improves the cost-accuracy trade-off, reducing latency and cloud API usage while maintaining competitive accuracy against strong structured reasoning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Adaptive Purification Controller for Quantum Networks: Dynamic Protocol Selection and Multipartite Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18351v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient entanglement distribution is a cornerstone of the Quantum Internet. However, physical link parameters such as photon loss, memory coherence time, and gate error rates fluctuate dynamically, rendering static purification strategies suboptimal. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Purification Controller (APC) that automatically optimizes the entanglement distillation sequence to maximize the goodput, i.e., the rate of delivered pairs meeting a strict fidelity threshold. By treating protocol selection as a resource allocation problem, the APC dynamically switches between purification depths and protocols (BBPSSW vs. DEJMPS) to navigate the trade-off between generation rate and state quality. Using a dynamic programming planner with Pareto pruning, simulation results show that our approach mitigates the "fidelity cliffs" inherent in static protocols and reduces resource wastage in high-noise regimes. Furthermore, we extend the controller to heterogeneous scenarios, and evaluate it for both multipartite GHZ state generation and continuous-variable systems using effective noiseless linear amplification models. We benchmark its computational overhead, showing decision latencies in the millisecond range per link in our implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Native LLM and MLLM Inference at Scale on Apple Silicon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19139v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models, leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21\% to 87\% higher throughput than llama-cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Nonparametric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07132v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026; 5 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
