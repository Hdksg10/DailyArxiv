| **[A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11560v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI 2026 (oral presentation).

Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to deliver high simulation rate or high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel \algorithmpropernoun{} algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. We apply this method and show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second and simulations achieving 84 PFLOP/s. Our implementation can achieve 90\% of peak performance in both single-node and clustered environments. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale running on a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures.

| **[To Offload or Not To Offload: Model-driven Comparison of Edge-native and On-device Processing In the Era of Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15162v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational offloading is a promising approach for overcoming resource constraints on client devices by moving some or all of an application's computations to remote servers. With the advent of specialized hardware accelerators, client devices can now perform fast local processing of specific tasks, such as machine learning inference, reducing the need for offloading computations. However, edge servers with accelerators also offer faster processing for offloaded tasks than was previously possible. In this paper, we present an analytic and experimental comparison of on-device processing and edge offloading for a range of accelerator, network, multi-tenant, and application workload scenarios, with the goal of understanding when to use local on-device processing and when to offload computations. We present models that leverage analytical queuing results to derive explainable closed-form equations for the expected end-to-end latencies of both strategies, which yield precise, quantitative performance crossover predictions that guide adaptive offloading. We experimentally validate our models across a range of scenarios and show that they achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 2.2% compared to observed latencies. We further use our models to develop a resource manager for adaptive offloading and show its effectiveness under variable network conditions and dynamic multi-tenant edge settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAGE: A Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator for distributed AI system co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10480v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on large-scale AI training and inference systems requires a scalable and expressive mechanism to model distributed workload execution. Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE is publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems: https://github.com/astra-sim/symbolic tensor graph</p></details> |  |
| **[Soteria: Efficient Symbolic Execution as a Functional Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08729v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic execution (SE) tools often rely on intermediate languages (ILs) to support multiple programming languages, promising reusability and efficiency. In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI as a component in the action research tradition of learning-by-doing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11445v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider learning mathematics through action research, hacking, discovery, inquiry, learning-by-doing as opposed to the instruct and perform, industrial model of the 19th century. A learning model based on self-awareness, types, functions, structured drawing and formal diagrams addresses the weaknesses of drill and practice and the pitfalls of statistical prediction with Large Language Models. In other words, we build mathematics/informatics education on the activity of a professional mathematician in mathematical modelling and designing programs. This tradition emphasises the role of dialogue and doing mathematics. In the Language/Action approach the teacher designs mathematising situations that scaffold previously encountered, or not-known-how-to-solve problems for the learner while teachers and teacher/interlocutors supervise the process. A critical feature is the written-oral dialogue between the learner and the teacher. As a rule, this is 1 to 1 communication. The role of the teacher/interlocutor, a more knowledgeable other, is mostly performed by a more senior student, 1 per 5 to 7 pupils. After Doug Engelbart we propose the metaphor of human intellect augmented by digital technologies such as interactive development environments or AI. Every human has their bio and digital parts. The bio part of the learner reacts to their work through dialogue in the mind. The digital part poses questions, interprets code and proposes not necessarily sound ideas.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Resolving Conflicts with Grace: Dynamically Concurrent Universality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04631v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a \emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it \emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum resources in resource management systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10052v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing resources are increasingly being incorporated into high-performance computing (HPC) environments as co-processors for hybrid workloads. To support this paradigm, quantum devices must be treated as schedulable first-class resources within existing HPC infrastructure. This enables consistent workload management, unified resource visibility, and support for hybrid quantum-classical job execution models. This paper presents a reference architecture and implementation for the integration of quantum computing resources, both on-premises and cloud-hosted into HPC centers via standard workload managers. We introduce a Slurm plugin designed to abstract and control quantum backends, enabling seamless resource scheduling, minimizing queue duplication, and supporting job co-scheduling with classical compute nodes. The architecture supports heterogeneous quantum resources and can be extended to any workload (and container) management systems.</p></details> |  |

Evidence from non-winning blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052v3)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an eight-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- appearing only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that, depending on the methodology, exclusive transactions account for between 77.2% and 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Moreover, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully attributed to persistent relationships between senders and builders: only between 7% and 8.4% of all on-chain exclusive transaction value originates from senders who route exclusively to one builder. Finally, we observe that transaction exclusivity is dynamic. Some transactions are exclusive at the start of a bidding cycle but later appear in blocks from multiple builders. Other transactions remain exclusive to a losing builder for two or three cycles before appearing in the public mempool. These transactions are therefore delayed and then exposed to potential attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2506.04940</p></details> |
| **[UFO$^3$: Weaving the Digital Agent Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11332v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are transforming digital devices from passive tools into proactive intelligent collaborators. However, most existing frameworks remain confined to a single OS or device, making cross-device workflows brittle and largely manual. We present UFO$^3$, a system that unifies heterogeneous endpoints, desktops, servers, mobile devices, and edge, into a single orchestration fabric. UFO$^3$ models each user request as a mutable TaskConstellation: a distributed DAG of atomic subtasks (TaskStars) with explicit control and data dependencies (TaskStarLines). The TaskConstellation continuously evolves as results stream in from distributed devices, enabling asynchronous execution, adaptive recovery, and dynamic optimization. A Constellation Orchestrator} executes tasks safely and asynchronously while applying dynamic DAG updates, and the Agent Interaction Protocol (AIP) provides persistent, low-latency channels for reliable task dispatch and result streaming. These designs dissolve the traditional boundaries between devices and platforms, allowing agents to collaborate seamlessly and amplify their collective intelligence. We evaluate UFO$^3$ on NebulaBench, a benchmark of 55 cross-device tasks across 5 machines and 10 categories. UFO$^3$ achieves 83.3% subtask completion, 70.9% task success, exposes parallelism with an average width of 1.72, and reduces end-to-end latency by 31% relative to a sequential baseline. Fault-injection experiments demonstrate graceful degradation and recovery under transient and permanent agent failures. These results show that UFO$^3$ achieves accurate, efficient, and resilient task orchestration across heterogeneous devices, uniting isolated agents into a coherent, adaptive computing fabric that extends across the landscape of ubiquitous computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We developed UFO$^3$ as a fully engineered system with over 73K lines of code, encompassing agent implementations and integrations for Windows, Linux, and Android mobile devices.

| **[The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography. In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kleene Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11264v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This booklet serves as an introduction to Kleene Algebra (KA), a set of laws that can be used to study general equivalences between programs. It discusses how general programs can be modeled using regular expressions, how those expressions correspond to automata, and how this correspondence can be exploited to obtain the central result of KA, namely that an equivalence of regular expressions is true if and only if it can be proved using the laws of KA. Each chapter closes with a set of exercises to further build intuition and understanding, and there is an optional chapter that develops automata theory through the lens of coalgebra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Refinement of Higher-Order Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10135v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Foxtrot, the first higher-order separation logic for proving contextual refinement of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order local state. From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library. All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMART: A Surrogate Model for Predicting Application Runtime in Dragonfly Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11111v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mapple: A Domain-Specific Language for Mapping Distributed Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17087v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing parallel programs for distributed systems is a complex task, often requiring significant code modifications. Task-based programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from application logic, but their mapping interfaces are low-level. We introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between task and processor spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads, Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14x and enables performance improvements of up to 1.34x over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose primitive achieves up to 1.83x improvement over existing dimensionality-resolution heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimising Density Computations in Probabilistic Programs via Automatic Loop Vectorisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11070v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a popular tool for high-level modelling across many fields. They provide a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference, which analyse models by learning their parameters from a dataset or estimating their posterior distributions. However, probabilistic inference is known to be very costly. One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic inference stems from the iteration over entries of a large dataset or a long series of random samples. Vectorisation can mitigate this cost, but manual vectorisation is error-prone, and existing automatic techniques are often ad-hoc and limited, unable to handle general repetition structures, such as nested loops and loops with data-dependent control flow, without significant user intervention. To address this bottleneck, we propose a sound and effective method for automatically vectorising loops in probabilistic programs. Our method achieves high throughput using speculative parallel execution of loop iterations, while preserving the semantics of the original loop through a fixed-point check. We formalise our method as a translation from an imperative PPL into a lower-level target language with primitives geared towards vectorisation. We implemented our method for the Pyro PPL and evaluated it on a range of probabilistic models. Our experiments show significant performance gains against an existing vectorisation baseline, achieving $1.1$--$6\times$ speedups and reducing GPU memory usage in many cases. Unlike the baseline, which is limited to a subset of models, our method effectively handled all the tested models.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 19 figures, the first two authors contributed equally to this work, accepted at POPL'26</p></details> |

We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended of paper accepted to appear at VMCAI'26; 29 Pages, including 2 Appendices</p></details> |
| **[SemanticNN: Compressive and Error-Resilient Semantic Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11038v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs. This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Cascading Bandits With Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10938v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a \emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it \emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography. In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.</p></details> |  |

From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library. All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Task-based programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from application logic, but their mapping interfaces are low-level. We introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between task and processor spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads, Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14x and enables performance improvements of up to 1.34x over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose primitive achieves up to 1.83x improvement over existing dimensionality-resolution heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimising Density Computations in Probabilistic Programs via Automatic Loop Vectorisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11070v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a popular tool for high-level modelling across many fields. They provide a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference, which analyse models by learning their parameters from a dataset or estimating their posterior distributions. However, probabilistic inference is known to be very costly. One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic inference stems from the iteration over entries of a large dataset or a long series of random samples. Vectorisation can mitigate this cost, but manual vectorisation is error-prone, and existing automatic techniques are often ad-hoc and limited, unable to handle general repetition structures, such as nested loops and loops with data-dependent control flow, without significant user intervention. To address this bottleneck, we propose a sound and effective method for automatically vectorising loops in probabilistic programs. Our method achieves high throughput using speculative parallel execution of loop iterations, while preserving the semantics of the original loop through a fixed-point check. We formalise our method as a translation from an imperative PPL into a lower-level target language with primitives geared towards vectorisation. We implemented our method for the Pyro PPL and evaluated it on a range of probabilistic models. Our experiments show significant performance gains against an existing vectorisation baseline, achieving $1.1$--$6\times$ speedups and reducing GPU memory usage in many cases. Unlike the baseline, which is limited to a subset of models, our method effectively handled all the tested models.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 19 figures, the first two authors contributed equally to this work, accepted at POPL'26</p></details> |

We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended of paper accepted to appear at VMCAI'26; 29 Pages, including 2 Appendices</p></details> |

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs. This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at AAAI 2026 (oral presentation).

With the advent of specialized hardware accelerators, client devices can now perform fast local processing of specific tasks, such as machine learning inference, reducing the need for offloading computations. However, edge servers with accelerators also offer faster processing for offloaded tasks than was previously possible. In this paper, we present an analytic and experimental comparison of on-device processing and edge offloading for a range of accelerator, network, multi-tenant, and application workload scenarios, with the goal of understanding when to use local on-device processing and when to offload computations. We present models that leverage analytical queuing results to derive explainable closed-form equations for the expected end-to-end latencies of both strategies, which yield precise, quantitative performance crossover predictions that guide adaptive offloading. We experimentally validate our models across a range of scenarios and show that they achieve a mean absolute percentage error of 2.2% compared to observed latencies. We further use our models to develop a resource manager for adaptive offloading and show its effectiveness under variable network conditions and dynamic multi-tenant edge settings.</p></details> |  |

Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication.

In practice, this approach introduces trade-offs between performance, accuracy, and language feature support. We argue that building SE engines \emph{directly} for each source language is both simpler and more effective. We present Soteria, a lightweight OCaml library for writing SE engines in a functional style, without compromising on performance, accuracy or feature support. Soteria enables developers to construct SE engines that operate directly over source-language semantics, offering \emph{configurability}, compositional reasoning, and ease of implementation. Using Soteria, we develop Soteria$^{\text{Rust}}$, the \emph{first} Rust SE engine supporting Tree Borrows (the intricate aliasing model of Rust), and Soteria$^{\text{C}}$, a compositional SE engine for C. Both tools are competitive with or outperform state-of-the-art tools such as Kani, Pulse, CBMC and Gillian-C in performance and the number of bugs detected. We formalise the theoretical foundations of Soteria and prove its soundness, demonstrating that sound, efficient, accurate, and expressive SE can be achieved without the compromises of ILs.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Jasmin Compiler Preserves Cryptographic Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11292v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jasmin is a programming and verification framework for developing efficient, formally verified, cryptographic implementations. A main component of the framework is the Jasmin compiler, which empowers programmers to write efficient implementations of state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives, including post-quantum cryptographic standards. The Jasmin compiler is proven functionally correct in the Rocq prover. However, this functional correctness statement does not apply to nonterminating or probabilistic computations, which are essential features in cryptography. In this paper, we significantly enhance the guarantees of the compiler by showing, in the Rocq prover, that its front-end (25 out of 30 passes) preserves cryptographic security. To this end, we first define a Relational Hoare Logic tailored for compiler correctness proofs. We prove the soundness of our logic w.r.t. a new denotational semantics of Jasmin programs based on interaction trees. Secondly, we use our program logic to prove the functional correctness of the (unmodified) Jasmin compiler w.r.t. said semantics. Lastly, we formalize cryptographic security -- focusing on IND-CCA -- with interaction trees and prove that the Jasmin compiler preserves cryptographic security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kleene Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11264v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This booklet serves as an introduction to Kleene Algebra (KA), a set of laws that can be used to study general equivalences between programs. It discusses how general programs can be modeled using regular expressions, how those expressions correspond to automata, and how this correspondence can be exploited to obtain the central result of KA, namely that an equivalence of regular expressions is true if and only if it can be proved using the laws of KA. Each chapter closes with a set of exercises to further build intuition and understanding, and there is an optional chapter that develops automata theory through the lens of coalgebra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Refinement of Higher-Order Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10135v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Foxtrot, the first higher-order separation logic for proving contextual refinement of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order local state. From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library. All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMART: A Surrogate Model for Predicting Application Runtime in Dragonfly Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11111v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mapple: A Domain-Specific Language for Mapping Distributed Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17087v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing parallel programs for distributed systems is a complex task, often requiring significant code modifications. Task-based programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from application logic, but their mapping interfaces are low-level. We introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between task and processor spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads, Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14x and enables performance improvements of up to 1.34x over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose primitive achieves up to 1.83x improvement over existing dimensionality-resolution heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimising Density Computations in Probabilistic Programs via Automatic Loop Vectorisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11070v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a popular tool for high-level modelling across many fields. They provide a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference, which analyse models by learning their parameters from a dataset or estimating their posterior distributions. However, probabilistic inference is known to be very costly. One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic inference stems from the iteration over entries of a large dataset or a long series of random samples. Vectorisation can mitigate this cost, but manual vectorisation is error-prone, and existing automatic techniques are often ad-hoc and limited, unable to handle general repetition structures, such as nested loops and loops with data-dependent control flow, without significant user intervention. To address this bottleneck, we propose a sound and effective method for automatically vectorising loops in probabilistic programs. Our method achieves high throughput using speculative parallel execution of loop iterations, while preserving the semantics of the original loop through a fixed-point check. We formalise our method as a translation from an imperative PPL into a lower-level target language with primitives geared towards vectorisation. We implemented our method for the Pyro PPL and evaluated it on a range of probabilistic models. Our experiments show significant performance gains against an existing vectorisation baseline, achieving $1.1$--$6\times$ speedups and reducing GPU memory usage in many cases. Unlike the baseline, which is limited to a subset of models, our method effectively handled all the tested models.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 19 figures, the first two authors contributed equally to this work, accepted at POPL'26</p></details> |

We repurpose the concept of digests -- summaries of computational histories originally introduced to bring tunable concurrency-sensitivity to thread-modular value analysis by abstract interpretation, extending this idea to race detection: We use digests to capture the conditions under which conflicting accesses may not happen in parallel. To formalize this, we give a definition of data races in the thread-modular local trace semantics and show how exclusion criteria for potential conflicts can be expressed as digests. We report on our implementation of digest-driven data race detection in the static analyzer Goblint, and evaluate it on the SV-COMP benchmark suite. Combining the lockset digest with digests reasoning on thread ids and thread joins increases the number of correctly solved tasks by more than a factor of five compared to lockset reasoning alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended of paper accepted to appear at VMCAI'26; 29 Pages, including 2 Appendices</p></details> |
| **[SemanticNN: Compressive and Error-Resilient Semantic Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11038v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICE: SLO-Driven Scheduling for LLM Inference on Edge Computing Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18544v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), as the foundational architecture for next-generation interactive AI applications, not only power intelligent dialogue systems but also drive the evolution of embodied intelligence on edge devices, including humanoid robots, smart vehicles, and other scenarios. The applications running on these edge devices impose differentiated Service Level Objectives (SLO) requirements on LLM services, specifically manifested as distinct constraints on Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) as well as end-to-end latency. Notably, edge devices typically handle real-time tasks that are extremely sensitive to latency, such as machine control and navigation planning. However, existing scheduling service systems still prioritize maximizing output token throughput as the sole optimization objective, failing to adequately address the diversity of SLO requirements. This ultimately results in persistently high violation rates for end-to-end latency or TPOT related SLOs. This paper proposes SLICE, an innovative scheduling solution designed for edge computing scenarios with differentiated SLO requirements. By combining a utility-maximizing request scheduling algorithm with a dynamic iterative control mechanism for generation rates, SLICE significantly improves LLM inference service SLO attainment. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art solutions Orca and FastServe, SLICE achieves up to 35x higher SLO attainment and 3.4x advantage in task completion time than the other two solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Cascading Bandits With Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10938v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
