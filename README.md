| **[SEDULity: A Proof-of-Learning Framework for Distributed and Secure Blockchains with Efficient Useful Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13666v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security and decentralization of Proof-of-Work (PoW) have been well-tested in existing blockchain systems. However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rows and Capabilities as Modal Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10301v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effect handlers allow programmers to model and compose computational effects modularly. Effect systems statically guarantee that all effects are handled. Several recent practical effect systems are based on either row polymorphism or capabilities. However, there remains a gap in understanding the precise relationship between effect systems with such disparate foundations. The main difficulty is that in both row-based and capability-based systems, effect tracking is typically entangled with other features such as functions. We propose a uniform framework for encoding, analysing, and comparing effect systems. Our framework exploits and generalises modal effect types, a recent novel effect system which decouples effect tracking from functions via modalities. Modalities offer fine-grained control over when and how effects are tracked, enabling us to express different strategies for effect tracking. We give encodings as macro translations from existing row-based and capability-based effect systems into our framework and show that these encodings preserve types and semantics. Our encodings reveal the essence of effect tracking mechanisms in different effect systems, enable a direct analysis on their differences, and provide practical insights on language design.</p></details> |  |

We propose "Design in Tiles (DiT)", an automated framework connecting a deployment toolchain with a configurable executable model for these accelerators. For evaluation, we apply our framework to GEMM targeting a large acceleration configuration (e.g., 32x32 tiles, 1979 TFLOPS@FP8, 4 TB/s Bandwidth) comparable to an NVIDIA GH200. We achieve higher PE utilization than GH200 with its expert-tuned GEMM libraries, achieving 1.2-2.0x speedup across diverse matrix shapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scheduling in Quantum Satellite Networks: Fairness and Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07108v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum satellite networks offer a promising solution for achieving long-distance quantum communication by enabling entanglement distribution across global scales. This work formulates and solves the quantum satellite network scheduling problem by optimizing satellite-to-ground station pair assignments under realistic system and environmental constraints. Our framework accounts for limited satellite and ground station resources, fairness, entanglement fidelity thresholds, and real world non-idealities including atmospheric losses, weather and background noise. In addition, we incorporate the complexities of multi-satellite relays enabled via inter-satellite links. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization framework that supports multiple scheduling objectives, allowing us to analyze tradeoffs between maximizing total entanglement distribution rate and ensuring fairness across ground station pairs. Our framework can also be used as a benchmark tool to measure the performance of other potential transmission scheduling policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[astroCAMP: A Community Benchmark and Co-Design Framework for Sustainable SKA-Scale Radio Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13591v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project will operate one of the world's largest continuous scientific data systems, sustaining petascale imaging under strict power caps. Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Janus: Disaggregating Attention and Experts for Scalable MoE Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13525v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference is challenging due to high resource demands and dynamic workloads. Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGMA: An AI-Empowered Training Stack on Early-Life Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13488v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing variety of AI accelerators is being considered for large-scale training. However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability. The source code of SIGMA is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LuciaTrainingPlatform.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LEGO: A Layout Expression Language for Code Generation of Hierarchical Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08091v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe LEGO, a new approach to optimizing data movement whereby code is expressed as a layout-independent computation and composed with layouts for data and computation. This code generator organization derives complex indexing expressions associated with hierarchical parallel code and data movement for GPUs. LEGO maps from layout specification to indexing expressions, and can be integrated into existing compilers and code templates. It facilitates the exploration of data layouts in combination with other optimizations. We demonstrate LEGO's integration with the Triton and MLIR compilers, and with CUDA templates. We show that LEGO is capable of deriving performance competitive with Triton, and shows broad applicability for data and thread layout mapping optimizations in its integration with CUDA and MLIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARS: A Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Simulator for Power Management in HPC Job Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13268v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) clusters consume enormous amounts of energy, with idle nodes as a major source of waste. Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Secure Decentralized Applications and Consensus Protocols in Blockchains (on Selfish Mining, Undercutting Attacks, DAG-Based Blockchains, E-Voting, Cryptocurrency Wallets, Secure-Logging, and CBDC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13213v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many new applications built on decentralized blockchains have emerged. Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems. In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of SeDuMi and SDPT3 Solvers for Stability of Continuous-time Linear System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04531v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SeDuMi and SDPT3 are two solvers for solving Semi-definite Programming (SDP) or Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. A computational performance comparison of these two are undertaken in this paper regarding the Stability of Continuous-time Linear Systems. The comparison mainly focuses on computational times and memory requirements for different scales of problems. To implement and compare the two solvers on a set of well-posed problems, we employ YALMIP, a widely used toolbox for modeling and optimization in MATLAB. The primary goal of this study is to provide an empirical assessment of the relative computational efficiency of SeDuMi and SDPT3 under varying problem conditions. Our evaluation indicates that SDPT3 performs much better in large-scale, high-precision calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version will be incorporated into another work</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDAN: Towards Understanding Memory Parallelism and Latency Sensitivity in HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13176v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource disaggregation is a promising technique for improving the efficiency of large-scale computing systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Self-Healing Networks-on-Chip: RL-Driven Routing in 2D Torus Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13096v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate adaptive minimal routing in 2D torus networks on chip NoCs under node fault conditions comparing a reinforcement learning RL based strategy to an adaptive routing baseline A torus topology is used for its low diameter high connectivity properties The RL approach models each router as an agent that learns to forward packets based on network state while the adaptive scheme uses fixed minimal paths with simple rerouting around faults We implement both methods in simulation injecting up to 50 node faults uniformly at random Key metrics are measured 1 throughput vs offered load at fault density 02 2 packet delivery ratio PDR vs fault density and 3 a fault adaptive score FT vs fault density Experimental results show the RL method achieves significantly higher throughput at high load approximately 2030 gain and maintains higher reliability under increasing faults The RL router delivers more packets per cycle and adapts to faults by exploiting path diversity whereas the adaptive scheme degrades sharply as faults accumulate In particular the RL approach preserves end to end connectivity longer PDR remains above 90 until approximately 3040 faults while adaptive PDR drops to approximately 70 at the same point The fault adaptive score likewise favors RL routing Thus RL based adaptive routing demonstrates clear advantages in throughput and fault resilience for torus NoCs</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Resource-Efficient Serverless LLM Inference with SLINFER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00507v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments, characterized by moderate-sized models and infrequent requests. While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at HPCA 2026</p></details> |
| **[SPIDER: Unleashing Sparse Tensor Cores for Stencil Computation via Strided Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22035v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on accelerating stencil computations by exploiting emerging hardware like Tensor Cores. To leverage these accelerators, the stencil operation must be transformed to matrix multiplications. However, this transformation introduces undesired sparsity into the kernel matrix, leading to significant redundant computation. In this paper, we present SPIDER, the first system to turn this unresolved sparsity into an optimization opportunity by exploring the potential of Sparse Tensor Cores (SpTCs) for stencil acceleration. Specifically, SPIDER introduces an efficient and elegant transformation method that integrates two cooperative techniques: an ahead-of-time strided swapping transformation for kernel matrices and an on-the-fly row-swapping mechanism for inputs. This rule-based approach effectively transforms stencil computation into operations compatible with SpTCs, introducing only slight compile-time overhead and zero runtime overhead. Additionally, SPIDER incorporates multiple optimizations to maximize computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SPIDER outperforms vendor library cuDNN by 6.20$\times$ and state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tensor Core-based approaches (ConvStencil, FlashFFTStencil, etc.) by 2.00$\times$ on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashFuser: Expanding the Scale of Kernel Fusion for Compute-Intensive Operators via Inter-Core Connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12949v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROSERVE: Unified Multi-Priority Request Scheduling for LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12928v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) for interactive applications necessitates serving systems that can handle thousands of concurrent requests with diverse Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements. A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities. To bridge this gap, we first \textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Janus: Disaggregating Attention and Experts for Scalable MoE Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13525v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference is challenging due to high resource demands and dynamic workloads. Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.</p></details> |  |

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability.

The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems. In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</p></details> |  |

A computational performance comparison of these two are undertaken in this paper regarding the Stability of Continuous-time Linear Systems. The comparison mainly focuses on computational times and memory requirements for different scales of problems. To implement and compare the two solvers on a set of well-posed problems, we employ YALMIP, a widely used toolbox for modeling and optimization in MATLAB. The primary goal of this study is to provide an empirical assessment of the relative computational efficiency of SeDuMi and SDPT3 under varying problem conditions.

| **[Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDAN: Towards Understanding Memory Parallelism and Latency Sensitivity in HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13176v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource disaggregation is a promising technique for improving the efficiency of large-scale computing systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at HPCA 2026</p></details> |

To leverage these accelerators, the stencil operation must be transformed to matrix multiplications. However, this transformation introduces undesired sparsity into the kernel matrix, leading to significant redundant computation. In this paper, we present SPIDER, the first system to turn this unresolved sparsity into an optimization opportunity by exploring the potential of Sparse Tensor Cores (SpTCs) for stencil acceleration. Specifically, SPIDER introduces an efficient and elegant transformation method that integrates two cooperative techniques: an ahead-of-time strided swapping transformation for kernel matrices and an on-the-fly row-swapping mechanism for inputs. This rule-based approach effectively transforms stencil computation into operations compatible with SpTCs, introducing only slight compile-time overhead and zero runtime overhead. Additionally, SPIDER incorporates multiple optimizations to maximize computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SPIDER outperforms vendor library cuDNN by 6.20$\times$ and state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tensor Core-based approaches (ConvStencil, FlashFFTStencil, etc.) by 2.00$\times$ on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashFuser: Expanding the Scale of Kernel Fusion for Compute-Intensive Operators via Inter-Core Connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12949v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROSERVE: Unified Multi-Priority Request Scheduling for LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12928v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) for interactive applications necessitates serving systems that can handle thousands of concurrent requests with diverse Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements. A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities. To bridge this gap, we first \textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.</p></details> |  |

Effect systems statically guarantee that all effects are handled. Several recent practical effect systems are based on either row polymorphism or capabilities. However, there remains a gap in understanding the precise relationship between effect systems with such disparate foundations. The main difficulty is that in both row-based and capability-based systems, effect tracking is typically entangled with other features such as functions. We propose a uniform framework for encoding, analysing, and comparing effect systems. Our framework exploits and generalises modal effect types, a recent novel effect system which decouples effect tracking from functions via modalities. Modalities offer fine-grained control over when and how effects are tracked, enabling us to express different strategies for effect tracking. We give encodings as macro translations from existing row-based and capability-based effect systems into our framework and show that these encodings preserve types and semantics. Our encodings reveal the essence of effect tracking mechanisms in different effect systems, enable a direct analysis on their differences, and provide practical insights on language design.</p></details> |  |

This work formulates and solves the quantum satellite network scheduling problem by optimizing satellite-to-ground station pair assignments under realistic system and environmental constraints. Our framework accounts for limited satellite and ground station resources, fairness, entanglement fidelity thresholds, and real world non-idealities including atmospheric losses, weather and background noise. In addition, we incorporate the complexities of multi-satellite relays enabled via inter-satellite links. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization framework that supports multiple scheduling objectives, allowing us to analyze tradeoffs between maximizing total entanglement distribution rate and ensuring fairness across ground station pairs. Our framework can also be used as a benchmark tool to measure the performance of other potential transmission scheduling policies.</p></details> |  |

It facilitates the exploration of data layouts in combination with other optimizations. We demonstrate LEGO's integration with the Triton and MLIR compilers, and with CUDA templates. We show that LEGO is capable of deriving performance competitive with Triton, and shows broad applicability for data and thread layout mapping optimizations in its integration with CUDA and MLIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARS: A Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Simulator for Power Management in HPC Job Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13268v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) clusters consume enormous amounts of energy, with idle nodes as a major source of waste. Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Blockchains are full-stack distributed systems where multiple sub-systems interact. While many deployed blockchains and decentralized applications need better scalability and performance, security is also critical. Due to their complexity, assessing blockchain and DAPP security requires a more holistic view than for traditional distributed or centralized systems. In this thesis, we summarize our contributions to blockchain and decentralized application security. We propose a security reference architecture to support standardized vulnerability and threat analysis. We study consensus security in single-chain Proof-of-Work blockchains, including resistance to selfish mining, undercutting, and greedy transaction selection, as well as related issues in DAG-based systems. We contribute to wallet security with a new classification of authentication schemes and a two-factor method based on One-Time Passwords. We advance e-voting with a practical boardroom voting protocol, extend it to a scalable version for millions of participants while preserving security and privacy, and introduce a repetitive voting framework that enables vote changes between elections while avoiding peak-end effects. Finally, we improve secure logging using blockchains and trusted computing through a centralized ledger that guarantees non-equivocation, integrity, and censorship evidence, then build on it to propose an interoperability protocol for central bank digital currencies that ensures atomic transfers.</p></details> |  |

A computational performance comparison of these two are undertaken in this paper regarding the Stability of Continuous-time Linear Systems. The comparison mainly focuses on computational times and memory requirements for different scales of problems. To implement and compare the two solvers on a set of well-posed problems, we employ YALMIP, a widely used toolbox for modeling and optimization in MATLAB. The primary goal of this study is to provide an empirical assessment of the relative computational efficiency of SeDuMi and SDPT3 under varying problem conditions. Our evaluation indicates that SDPT3 performs much better in large-scale, high-precision calculations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version will be incorporated into another work</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDAN: Towards Understanding Memory Parallelism and Latency Sensitivity in HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13176v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource disaggregation is a promising technique for improving the efficiency of large-scale computing systems. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory access latency due to the need to rely on the network fabric to transfer data between remote nodes. As such, it is crucial to ascertain an application's memory latency sensitivity to minimize the overall performance impact. Existing tools for measuring memory latency sensitivity often rely on custom ad-hoc hardware or cycle-accurate simulators, which can be inflexible and time-consuming. To address this, we present EDAN (Execution DAG Analyzer), a novel performance analysis tool that leverages an application's runtime instruction trace to generate its corresponding execution DAG. This approach allows us to estimate the latency sensitivity of sequential programs and investigate the impact of different hardware configurations. EDAN not only provides us with the capability of calculating the theoretical bounds for performance metrics, but it also helps us gain insight into the memory-level parallelism inherent to HPC applications. We apply EDAN to applications and benchmarks such as PolyBench, HPCG, and LULESH to unveil the characteristics of their intrinsic memory-level parallelism and latency sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Resource-Efficient Serverless LLM Inference with SLINFER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00507v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments, characterized by moderate-sized models and infrequent requests. While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at HPCA 2026</p></details> |
| **[SPIDER: Unleashing Sparse Tensor Cores for Stencil Computation via Strided Swapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22035v3)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on accelerating stencil computations by exploiting emerging hardware like Tensor Cores. To leverage these accelerators, the stencil operation must be transformed to matrix multiplications. However, this transformation introduces undesired sparsity into the kernel matrix, leading to significant redundant computation. In this paper, we present SPIDER, the first system to turn this unresolved sparsity into an optimization opportunity by exploring the potential of Sparse Tensor Cores (SpTCs) for stencil acceleration. Specifically, SPIDER introduces an efficient and elegant transformation method that integrates two cooperative techniques: an ahead-of-time strided swapping transformation for kernel matrices and an on-the-fly row-swapping mechanism for inputs. This rule-based approach effectively transforms stencil computation into operations compatible with SpTCs, introducing only slight compile-time overhead and zero runtime overhead. Additionally, SPIDER incorporates multiple optimizations to maximize computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SPIDER outperforms vendor library cuDNN by 6.20$\times$ and state-of-the-art (SOTA) Tensor Core-based approaches (ConvStencil, FlashFFTStencil, etc.) by 2.00$\times$ on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlashFuser: Expanding the Scale of Kernel Fusion for Compute-Intensive Operators via Inter-Core Connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12949v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of computation throughput continues to outpace improvements in memory bandwidth, making many deep learning workloads memory-bound. Kernel fusion is a key technique to alleviate this problem, but the fusion strategies of existing compilers and frameworks are limited to using local scratchpad memory. When the intermediate results exceed the limited capacity (such as FFN), the fusion fails. Although modern GPUs (like the NVIDIA H100) now incorporate an inter-core connection mechanism known as Distributed Shared Memory(DSM)--providing a larger, high-bandwidth, and low-latency on-chip memory pool--this hardware potential has yet to be exploited by software frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present FlashFuser, the first compiler framework to utilize inter-core connection for kernel fusion on modern GPUs. FlashFuser extends established fusion techniques to the DSM domain through three core contributions. First, we propose a powerful DSM-based communication abstraction that formalizes complex cluster-based data exchange patterns, such as reduce, shuffle and multiply. Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROSERVE: Unified Multi-Priority Request Scheduling for LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12928v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) for interactive applications necessitates serving systems that can handle thousands of concurrent requests with diverse Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements. A critical yet often overlooked dimension in this context is the inherent priority difference among clients; for instance, business-critical functions demand higher performance guarantees, as fulfilling such requests yields significantly greater business value. However, existing LLM serving schedulers fail to jointly optimize for both SLO attainment and client-level priorities. To bridge this gap, we first \textit{formalize multi-priority request scheduling as a service gain maximization problem}, where satisfying latency requirements for requests of different priorities contributes varying levels of gain. We then propose PROSERVE, a unified two-tier scheduling framework designed to maximize overall service gain. At the engine level, SlideBatching dynamically adapts batch formation and request ordering under varying load conditions, employing a sliding boundary mechanism to balance deadline-first and density-first strategies. At the service level, GoRouting performs gain-oriented and capability-aware dispatching across distributed instances, proactively reserving capacity for future high-priority or long requests. Extensive evaluation across four open-source datasets and a real-world industrial trace demonstrates that \systemname{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving system gain by up to 35% and boosting SLO attainment by up to 52%.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |
