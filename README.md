| **[Location-Aware Dispersion on Anonymous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05948v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$. Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 figures, 6 pseudo-codes</p></details> |

Modeling the Control of an Adaptable Discrete System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23496v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When designing new web applications, developers must cope with different kinds of constraints relative to the resources they rely on: software, hardware, network, online micro-services, or any combination of the mentioned entities. Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks.

| **[An Equational Axiomatization of Dynamic Threads via Algebraic Effects: Presheaves on Finite Relations, Labelled Posets, and Parameterized Algebraic Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05850v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at POPL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Opportunistically Parallel Lambda Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11361v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scripting languages are widely used to compose external calls such as native libraries and network services. In such scripts, execution time is often dominated by waiting for these external calls, rendering traditional single-language optimizations ineffective. To address this, we propose a novel opportunistic evaluation strategy for scripting languages based on a core lambda calculus that automatically dispatches independent external calls in parallel and streams their results. We prove that our approach is confluent, ensuring that it preserves the programmer's original intent, and that it eventually executes every external call. We implement this approach in a scripting language called Opal. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of Opal, focusing on programs that invoke heavy external computation through the use of large language models (LLMs) and other APIs. Across five scripts, we compare to several state-of-the-art baselines and show that opportunistic evaluation improves total running time (up to $6.2\times$) and latency (up to $12.7\times$) compared to standard sequential Python, while performing very close (between $1.3\%$ and $18.5\%$ running time overhead) to hand-tuned manually optimized asynchronous Rust. For Tree-of-Thoughts, a prominent LLM reasoning approach, we achieve a $6.2\times$ performance improvement over the authors' own implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $α$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (α-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $Ω( \frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimelyFreeze: Adaptive Parameter Freezing Mechanism for Pipeline Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05754v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pipeline parallelism enables training models that exceed single-device memory, but practical throughput remains limited by pipeline bubbles. Although parameter freezing can improve training throughput by adaptively skipping backward computation, existing methods often over-freeze parameters, resulting in unnecessary accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose TimelyFreeze, which models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph and solves a linear program to compute optimal freeze ratios that minimize batch execution time under accuracy constraints. Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Device Association and Resource Allocation for Hierarchical Split Federated Learning in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13817v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6G facilitates deployment of Federated Learning (FL) in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN), yet FL confronts challenges such as resource constrained and unbalanced data distribution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework and derives its upper bound of loss function. To minimize the weighted sum of training loss and latency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates device association, model split layer selection, and resource allocation. We decompose the original problem into several subproblems, where an iterative optimization algorithm for device association and resource allocation based on brute-force split point search is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively balance training efficiency and model accuracy for FL in SAGIN.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICPE 2026 (International Conference on Performance Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[FedRandom: Sampling Consistent and Accurate Contribution Values in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05693v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid for problems with heterogeneous and anisotropic materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05686v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.</p></details> | FSCD 2026 submission |
| **[Wasure: A Modular Toolkit for Comprehensive WebAssembly Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05488v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) has become a key compilation target for portable and efficient execution across diverse platforms. Benchmarking its performance, however, is a multi-dimensional challenge: it depends not only on the choice of runtime engines, but also on hardware architectures, application domains, source languages, benchmark suites, and runtime configurations. This paper introduces Wasure, a modular and extensible command-line toolkit that simplifies the execution and comparison of WebAssembly benchmarks. To complement performance evaluation, we also conducted a dynamic analysis of the benchmark suites included with Wasure. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in code coverage, control flow, and execution patterns, emphasizing the need for benchmark diversity. Wasure aims to support researchers and developers in conducting more systematic, transparent, and insightful evaluations of WebAssembly engines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sovereign-by-Design A Reference Architecture for AI and Blockchain Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05486v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 < 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Privacy Analysis of Decentralized Gossip Averaging under Varying Threat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19969v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in fully decentralized machine learning is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a framework for DP analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph. We present an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes. Our main contribution is showing that the DP guarantees are those of a Gaussian mechanism, where the growth of the squared sensitivity is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation. As an application of the sensitivity analysis, we show that the excess risk of decentralized private learning for strongly convex losses is asymptotically similar as in centralized private learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Reaching Univalency with Subquadratic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05356v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dolev-Reischuk lower bound establishes that any deterministic Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol for $n$ processors tolerating $f$ faults requires $Ω(f^2+n)$ messages. But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $Ω(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward? We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \log f)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Append-Only Ledgers for (Mostly) Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05346v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed ledgers are increasingly relied upon by industry to provide trustworthy accountability, strong integrity protection, and high availability for critical data without centralizing trust. Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises.</p></details> |  |

To address these efficiency bottlenecks across diverse platforms, this paper proposes Opt4GPTQ, a practical optimization method designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering Optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches frequently accessed data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading Optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly Optimization (ILA-Opt), which directly leverages hardwarenative vector half-precision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves performance across various models while maintaining original model accuracy, achieving throughput gains of up to 84.42%. This work highlights the critical role of platformlevel engineering in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging architectures and provides valuable methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments. We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.</p></details> |  |

| **[Opportunistically Parallel Lambda Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11361v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scripting languages are widely used to compose external calls such as native libraries and network services. In such scripts, execution time is often dominated by waiting for these external calls, rendering traditional single-language optimizations ineffective. To address this, we propose a novel opportunistic evaluation strategy for scripting languages based on a core lambda calculus that automatically dispatches independent external calls in parallel and streams their results. We prove that our approach is confluent, ensuring that it preserves the programmer's original intent, and that it eventually executes every external call. We implement this approach in a scripting language called Opal. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of Opal, focusing on programs that invoke heavy external computation through the use of large language models (LLMs) and other APIs. Across five scripts, we compare to several state-of-the-art baselines and show that opportunistic evaluation improves total running time (up to $6.2\times$) and latency (up to $12.7\times$) compared to standard sequential Python, while performing very close (between $1.3\%$ and $18.5\%$ running time overhead) to hand-tuned manually optimized asynchronous Rust. For Tree-of-Thoughts, a prominent LLM reasoning approach, we achieve a $6.2\times$ performance improvement over the authors' own implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $α$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (α-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $Ω( \frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</p></details> |  |

Although parameter freezing can improve training throughput by adaptively skipping backward computation, existing methods often over-freeze parameters, resulting in unnecessary accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose TimelyFreeze, which models the pipeline schedule as a directed acyclic graph and solves a linear program to compute optimal freeze ratios that minimize batch execution time under accuracy constraints. Experiments show that TimelyFreeze achieves up to 40% training throughput improvement on LLaMA-8B with comparable accuracy. Overall, it enables faster large-scale model training without compromising convergence and generalizes across diverse pipeline-parallel settings.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Split Federated Learning (HSFL) framework and derives its upper bound of loss function. To minimize the weighted sum of training loss and latency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that integrates device association, model split layer selection, and resource allocation. We decompose the original problem into several subproblems, where an iterative optimization algorithm for device association and resource allocation based on brute-force split point search is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively balance training efficiency and model accuracy for FL in SAGIN.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICPE 2026 (International Conference on Performance Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[FedRandom: Sampling Consistent and Accurate Contribution Values in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05693v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid for problems with heterogeneous and anisotropic materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05686v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.</p></details> | FSCD 2026 submission |

Benchmarking its performance, however, is a multi-dimensional challenge: it depends not only on the choice of runtime engines, but also on hardware architectures, application domains, source languages, benchmark suites, and runtime configurations. This paper introduces Wasure, a modular and extensible command-line toolkit that simplifies the execution and comparison of WebAssembly benchmarks. To complement performance evaluation, we also conducted a dynamic analysis of the benchmark suites included with Wasure. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in code coverage, control flow, and execution patterns, emphasizing the need for benchmark diversity. Wasure aims to support researchers and developers in conducting more systematic, transparent, and insightful evaluations of WebAssembly engines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sovereign-by-Design A Reference Architecture for AI and Blockchain Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05486v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 < 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Privacy Analysis of Decentralized Gossip Averaging under Varying Threat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19969v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in fully decentralized machine learning is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a framework for DP analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph. We present an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes. Our main contribution is showing that the DP guarantees are those of a Gaussian mechanism, where the growth of the squared sensitivity is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation. As an application of the sensitivity analysis, we show that the excess risk of decentralized private learning for strongly convex losses is asymptotically similar as in centralized private learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Reaching Univalency with Subquadratic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05356v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dolev-Reischuk lower bound establishes that any deterministic Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol for $n$ processors tolerating $f$ faults requires $Ω(f^2+n)$ messages. But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $Ω(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward? We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \log f)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Append-Only Ledgers for (Mostly) Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05346v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed ledgers are increasingly relied upon by industry to provide trustworthy accountability, strong integrity protection, and high availability for critical data without centralizing trust. Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises.</p></details> |  |

To address these efficiency bottlenecks across diverse platforms, this paper proposes Opt4GPTQ, a practical optimization method designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering Optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches frequently accessed data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading Optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly Optimization (ILA-Opt), which directly leverages hardwarenative vector half-precision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves performance across various models while maintaining original model accuracy, achieving throughput gains of up to 84.42%. This work highlights the critical role of platformlevel engineering in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging architectures and provides valuable methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments. We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.</p></details> |  |

| **[Location-Aware Dispersion on Anonymous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05948v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\sf{col}(v) \in C = \{c_1, \dots, c_t\}, t\leq n$. A set $R = \{r_1, \dots, r_k\}$ of $k \leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\mathsf{col}(r_i) \in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$. Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 2 figures, 6 pseudo-codes</p></details> |

Together, these entities form a complex system of communicating interdependent processes, physical or logical. It is very desirable that such system ensures its robustness to provide a good quality of service. In this paper we introduce Chips, a language that aims at facilitating the design of models made of various entwined components. It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks. Chips mixes notions from control theory and general purpose programming languages to generate robust component-based models.

Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at POPL 2026</p></details> |

Our result breaks the $Ω( \frac{n^2}{2^α} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $Ω( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</p></details> |  |

| **[Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICPE 2026 (International Conference on Performance Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[FedRandom: Sampling Consistent and Accurate Contribution Values in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05693v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid for problems with heterogeneous and anisotropic materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05686v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a material-aware strength-of-connection measure for smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid methods, aimed at improving robustness for scalar partial differential equations with heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties. Classical strength-of-connection measures typically rely only on matrix entries or geometric distances, which often fail to capture weak couplings across material interfaces or align with anisotropy directions, ultimately leading to poor convergence. The proposed approach directly incorporates material tensor information into the coarsening process, enabling a reliable detection of weak connections and ensuring that coarse levels preserve the true structure of the underlying problem. As a result, smooth error components are represented properly and sharp coefficient jumps or directional anisotropies are handled consistently. A wide range of academic tests and real-world applications, including thermally activated batteries and solar cells, demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robustness across material contrasts, anisotropies, and mesh variations. Scalability and parallel performance of the algebraic multigrid method highlight the suitability for large-scale, high-performance computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong Normalisation for Asynchronous Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05528v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous effects of Ahman and Pretnar complement the conventional synchronous treatment of algebraic computational effects with asynchrony based on decoupling the execution of algebraic operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and into interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing matching interrupt handlers. Beyond providing asynchrony for algebraic effects, the resulting core calculus also naturally models examples such as pre-emptive multi-threading, (cancellable) remote function calls, multi-party applications, and even a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects. In this paper, we study the normalisation properties of this calculus. We prove that if one removes general recursion from the original calculus, then the remaining calculus is strongly normalising, including both its sequential and parallel parts. However, this only guarantees termination for very simple asynchronous examples. To improve on this result, we also prove that the sequential fragment of the calculus remains strongly normalising when a controlled amount of interrupt-driven recursive behaviour is reintroduced. Our strong normalisation proofs are structured compositionally as a natural extension of Lindley and Stark's $\top\top$-lifting based approach for proving strong normalisation of effectful languages. All our results are also formalised in Agda.</p></details> | FSCD 2026 submission |
| **[Wasure: A Modular Toolkit for Comprehensive WebAssembly Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05488v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly (Wasm) has become a key compilation target for portable and efficient execution across diverse platforms. Benchmarking its performance, however, is a multi-dimensional challenge: it depends not only on the choice of runtime engines, but also on hardware architectures, application domains, source languages, benchmark suites, and runtime configurations. This paper introduces Wasure, a modular and extensible command-line toolkit that simplifies the execution and comparison of WebAssembly benchmarks. To complement performance evaluation, we also conducted a dynamic analysis of the benchmark suites included with Wasure. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in code coverage, control flow, and execution patterns, emphasizing the need for benchmark diversity. Wasure aims to support researchers and developers in conducting more systematic, transparent, and insightful evaluations of WebAssembly engines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sovereign-by-Design A Reference Architecture for AI and Blockchain Enabled Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05486v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital sovereignty has emerged as a central concern for modern software-intensive systems, driven by the dominance of non-sovereign cloud infrastructures, the rapid adoption of Generative AI, and increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. While existing initiatives address governance, compliance, and security in isolation, they provide limited guidance on how sovereignty can be operationalized at the architectural level. In this paper, we argue that sovereignty must be treated as a first-class architectural property rather than a purely regulatory objective. We introduce a Sovereign Reference Architecture that integrates self-sovereign identity, blockchain-based trust and auditability, sovereign data governance, and Generative AI deployed under explicit architectural control. The architecture explicitly captures the dual role of Generative AI as both a source of governance risk and an enabler of compliance, accountability, and continuous assurance when properly constrained. By framing sovereignty as an architectural quality attribute, our work bridges regulatory intent and concrete system design, offering a coherent foundation for building auditable, evolvable, and jurisdiction-aware AI-enabled systems. The proposed reference architecture provides a principled starting point for future research and practice at the intersection of software architecture, Generative AI, and digital sovereignty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 < 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Privacy Analysis of Decentralized Gossip Averaging under Varying Threat Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19969v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving differential privacy (DP) guarantees in fully decentralized machine learning is challenging due to the absence of a central aggregator and varying trust assumptions among nodes. We present a framework for DP analysis of decentralized gossip-based averaging algorithms with additive node-level noise, from arbitrary views of nodes in a graph. We present an analytical framework based on a linear systems formulation that accurately characterizes privacy leakage between nodes. Our main contribution is showing that the DP guarantees are those of a Gaussian mechanism, where the growth of the squared sensitivity is asymptotically $O(T)$, where $T$ is the number of training rounds, similarly as in the case of central aggregation. As an application of the sensitivity analysis, we show that the excess risk of decentralized private learning for strongly convex losses is asymptotically similar as in centralized private learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the MoE LLM Trilemma: Dynamic Expert Clustering with Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02345v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Reaching Univalency with Subquadratic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05356v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dolev-Reischuk lower bound establishes that any deterministic Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol for $n$ processors tolerating $f$ faults requires $Ω(f^2+n)$ messages. But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $Ω(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward? We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $ε$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $ε$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - ε)$. Crucially, any $ε$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $ε$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $ε$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency. We also define Extractable BA for authenticated settings, capturing when processors collectively hold enough signed messages to determine the agreed value, and show it can be solved with communication complexity $O(f \log f)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Append-Only Ledgers for (Mostly) Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05346v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed ledgers are increasingly relied upon by industry to provide trustworthy accountability, strong integrity protection, and high availability for critical data without centralizing trust. Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs. Proteus carefully embeds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocol inside of a CFT protocol with no additional messages. This is made possible through careful refactoring of both the CFT and BFT protocols such that their structure aligns. Proteus achieves performance in line with regular TEE-enabled consensus protocols, while guaranteeing integrity in the face of TEE platform compromises.</p></details> |  |

To address these efficiency bottlenecks across diverse platforms, this paper proposes Opt4GPTQ, a practical optimization method designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering Optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches frequently accessed data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading Optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly Optimization (ILA-Opt), which directly leverages hardwarenative vector half-precision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves performance across various models while maintaining original model accuracy, achieving throughput gains of up to 84.42%. This work highlights the critical role of platformlevel engineering in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging architectures and provides valuable methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACL: Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05292v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications are moving away from monolithic designs to microservice and serverless architectures, where fleets of lightweight and independently deployable components run on public clouds. Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments. We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints. Experiments on representative open-source microservice workloads show that ORACL improves root-cause identification accuracy by 15 percent, accelerates training by up to 24x, and improves quality of service by 6 percent in short-term scenarios, without deployment-specific retraining.</p></details> |  |
