| **[An Adaptive Multi-Layered Honeynet Architecture for Threat Behavior Analysis via Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07827v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating sophistication and variety of cyber threats have rendered static honeypots inadequate, necessitating adaptive, intelligence-driven deception. In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence.</p></details> |  |

| **[Quantifying the Carbon Reduction of DAG Workloads: A Job Shop Scheduling Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07799v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carbon-aware schedulers aim to reduce the operational carbon footprint of data centers by running flexible workloads during periods of low carbon intensity. Most schedulers treat workloads as single monolithic tasks, ignoring that many jobs, like video encoding or offline inference, consist of smaller tasks with specific dependencies and resource needs; however, knowledge of this structure enables opportunities for greater carbon efficiency. We quantify the maximum benefit of a dependency-aware approach for batch workloads. We model the problem as a flexible job-shop scheduling variant and use an offline solver to compute upper bounds on carbon and energy savings. Results show up to $25\%$ lower carbon emissions on average without increasing the optimal makespan (total job completion time) compared to a makespan-only baseline. Although in heterogeneous server setup, these schedules may use more energy than energy-optimal ones. Our results also show that allowing twice the optimal makespan nearly doubles the carbon savings, underscoring the tension between carbon, energy, and makespan. We also highlight key factors such as job structure and server count influence the achievable carbon reductions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Co-operation in Systems of Hierarchical, Multi-objective Schedulers for Stream Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07792v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stream processing is a computing paradigm that supports real-time data processing for a wide variety of applications. At Meta, it's used across the company for various tasks such as deriving product insights, providing and improving user services, and enabling AI at scale for our ever-growing user base. Meta's current stream processing framework supports processing TerraBytes(TBs) of data in mere seconds. This is enabled by our efficient schedulers and multi-layered infrastructure, which allocate workloads across various compute resources, working together in hierarchies across various parts of the infrastructure. But with the ever growing complexity of applications, and user needs, areas of the infrastructure that previously required minimal load balancing, now must be made more robust and proactive to application load. In our work we explore how to build and design such a system that focuses on load balancing over key compute resources and properties of these applications. We also showcase how to integrate new schedulers into the hierarchy of the existing ones, allowing multiple schedulers to work together and perform load balancing, at their infrastructure level, effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polymorphic Coverage Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03393v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test input generators are an important part of property-based testing (PBT) frameworks, and a key expectation is that they be capable of producing all acceptable elements that satisfy both the function's input type and the generator-provided constraints. However, it is not readily apparent how to validate whether a particular generator's output satisfies this coverage requirement. In practice, developers typically rely on manual inspection and post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine whether a generator provides sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone and difficult to scale as generators grow more complex. To address this problem, we present a new refinement-type-based verification procedure for validating the coverage provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of types that embeds "must-style" underapproximate reasoning principles as a fundamental part of the type system. In our formulation, the types associated with expressions capture the set of values guaranteed to be produced by the expression, rather than the usual interpretation in which types represent the set of values an expression may produce. We formalize the notion of coverage types in a rich core language supporting higher-order functions and inductive datatypes. To better support real-world test generators, we extend this type system with type and qualifier polymorphism, enabling static verification of coverage guarantees for test input generators constructed using the monadic combinators found in most PBT frameworks. Finally, we have implemented a coverage type checker for OCaml programs based on this core calculus and present a detailed evaluation of its utility using a corpus of benchmarks drawn from both the PBT literature and open-source projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is an extended version of our PLDI 2023 conference paper: Covering All the Bases: Type-Based Verification of Test Input Generators</p></details> |
| **[A Performance Analyzer for a Public Cloud's ML-Augmented VM Allocator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07750v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many operational cloud systems use one or more machine learning models that help them achieve better efficiency and performance. But operators do not have tools to help them understand how each model and the interaction between them affect the end-to-end system performance. SANJESH is such a tool. SANJESH supports a diverse set of performance-related queries which we answer through a bi-level optimization. We invent novel mechanisms to solve this optimization more quickly. These techniques allow us to solve an optimization which prior work failed to solve even after $24$ hours. As a proof of concept, we apply SANJESH to an example production system that uses multiple ML models to optimize virtual machine (VM) placement. These models impact how many servers the operators uses to host VMs and the frequency with which it has to live-migrate them because the servers run out of resources. SANJESH finds scenarios where these models cause $~4\times$ worse performance than what simulation-based approaches detect.</p></details> |  |
| **[From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |
| **[Análisis de rendimiento y eficiencia energética en el cluster Raspberry Pi Cronos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07622v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents an evaluation of the computational performance and energy efficiency of the Cronos cluster, composed of Raspberry Pi4 and 3b microcomputers designed for educational purposes. Experimental tests were performed using the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, under a resource management environment configured with Slurm and parallel communication via Open MPI. The study focuses on analyzing scalability, stability, and power consumption during the execution of computationally intensive workloads, considering different node configurations. The results show that the cluster achieves a performance of up to 6.91 GFLOPS in homogeneous configurations of 6 Raspberry Pi 4 nodes, and that the use of heterogeneous nodes (including Raspberry Pi 3b) can negatively impact stability and efficiency. Additionally, the total electrical consumption of the system was measured during the runs, allowing for the estimation of the performance-to-consumption ratio (GFLOPS/W) as a comparative metric. This study constitutes a concrete contribution to the design, evaluation, and utilization of low-cost ARM clusters in educational and research contexts.</p></details> | in Spanish language |
| **[H2EAL: Hybrid-Bonding Architecture with Hybrid Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16653v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bandwidth-Aware Network Topology Optimization for Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07536v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network topology is critical for efficient parameter synchronization in distributed learning over networks. However, most existing studies do not account for bandwidth limitations in network topology design. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware network topology optimization framework to maximize consensus speed under edge cardinality constraints. For heterogeneous bandwidth scenarios, we introduce a maximum bandwidth allocation strategy for the edges to ensure efficient communication among nodes. By reformulating the problem into an equivalent Mixed-Integer SDP problem, we leverage a computationally efficient ADMM-based method to obtain topologies that yield the maximum consensus speed. Within the ADMM substep, we adopt the conjugate gradient method to efficiently solve large-scale linear equations to achieve better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting network topologies outperform the benchmark topologies in terms of consensus speed, and reduce the training time required for decentralized learning tasks on real-world datasets to achieve the target test accuracy, exhibiting speedups of more than $1.11\times$ and $1.21\times$ for homogeneous and heterogeneous bandwidth settings, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Canonical bidirectional typechecking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07511v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the checkable/synthesisable split in bidirectional typechecking coincides with existing dualities in polarised System L, also known as polarised $μ\tildeμ$-calculus. Specifically, positive terms and negative coterms are checkable, and negative terms and positive coterms are synthesisable. This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative. This yields a remarkable 3-way coincidence between the shifts of polarised System L, LNL calculi, and bidirectional calculi.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdapTT: Functoriality for Dependent Type Casts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13774v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to cast values between related types is a leitmotiv of many flavors of dependent type theory, such as observational type theories, subtyping, or cast calculi for gradual typing. These casts all exhibit a common structural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type formers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect to an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for functorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts on general inductive type formers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version, with appendices, of a paper published at POPL '26</p></details> |
| **[AFarePart: Accuracy-aware Fault-resilient Partitioner for DNN Edge Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07449v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across distributed and resource-constrained platforms, such as System-on-Chip (SoC) accelerators and edge-cloud systems. DNNs are often partitioned and executed across heterogeneous processing units to optimize latency and energy. However, the reliability of these partitioned models under hardware faults and communication errors remains a critical yet underexplored topic, especially in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware, fault-resilient DNN partitioning framework targeting multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II, where accuracy degradation under fault conditions is introduced as a core metric alongside energy and latency. Our framework performs runtime fault injection during optimization and utilizes a feedback loop to prioritize fault-tolerant partitioning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark CNNs including AlexNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet18 on hardware accelerators, and demonstrate up to 27.7% improvement in fault tolerance with minimal increase in performance overhead. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating resilience into DNN partitioning, and thereby paving the way for robust AI inference in error-prone environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The system is part of the National High Performance Computing (NHR) initiative. Otus complements the previous supercomputer Noctua 2, offering approximately twice the computing power while retaining the three node types that were characteristic of Noctua 2: 1) CPU compute nodes with different memory capacities, 2) high-end GPU nodes, and 3) HPC-grade FPGA nodes.

On the Green500 list, ranking the 500 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world, Otus is in position 5 with the GPU partition (June 2025). This article provides a comprehensive overview of the system in terms of its hardware, software, system integration, and its overall integration into the data center building to ensure energy-efficient operation.

| **[Communication-Efficient Serving for Video Diffusion Models with Latent Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07350v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) perform attention computation over the 3D spatio-temporal domain. Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services.</p></details> | 19 pages |

While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026</p></details> |
| **[DCO: Dynamic Cache Orchestration for LLM Accelerators through Predictive Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07312v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing. We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups. Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[PIP: Making Andersen's Points-to Analysis Sound and Practical for Incomplete C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07299v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

However, modern Industrial Internet of Things systems increasingly operate over distributed, resource-constrained edge-cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes a structured approach for decentralizing process mining by enabling event data to be mined directly within the IoT systems edge-cloud continuum. We introduce ContinuumConductor a layered decision framework that guides when to perform process mining tasks such as preprocessing, correlation, and discovery centrally or decentrally. Thus, enabling privacy, responsive and resource-efficient process mining. For each step in the process mining pipeline, we analyze the trade-offs of decentralization versus centralization across these layers and propose decision criteria. We demonstrate ContinuumConductor at a real-world use-case of process optimazition in inland ports. Our contributions lay the foundation for computing-aware process mining in cyber-physical and IIoT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COMINDS workshop ICPM2025</p></details> |

However, it is not readily apparent how to validate whether a particular generator's output satisfies this coverage requirement. In practice, developers typically rely on manual inspection and post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine whether a generator provides sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone and difficult to scale as generators grow more complex. To address this problem, we present a new refinement-type-based verification procedure for validating the coverage provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of types that embeds "must-style" underapproximate reasoning principles as a fundamental part of the type system. In our formulation, the types associated with expressions capture the set of values guaranteed to be produced by the expression, rather than the usual interpretation in which types represent the set of values an expression may produce. We formalize the notion of coverage types in a rich core language supporting higher-order functions and inductive datatypes. To better support real-world test generators, we extend this type system with type and qualifier polymorphism, enabling static verification of coverage guarantees for test input generators constructed using the monadic combinators found in most PBT frameworks. Finally, we have implemented a coverage type checker for OCaml programs based on this core calculus and present a detailed evaluation of its utility using a corpus of benchmarks drawn from both the PBT literature and open-source projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is an extended version of our PLDI 2023 conference paper: Covering All the Bases: Type-Based Verification of Test Input Generators</p></details> |

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use.

However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bandwidth-Aware Network Topology Optimization for Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07536v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network topology is critical for efficient parameter synchronization in distributed learning over networks. However, most existing studies do not account for bandwidth limitations in network topology design. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware network topology optimization framework to maximize consensus speed under edge cardinality constraints. For heterogeneous bandwidth scenarios, we introduce a maximum bandwidth allocation strategy for the edges to ensure efficient communication among nodes. By reformulating the problem into an equivalent Mixed-Integer SDP problem, we leverage a computationally efficient ADMM-based method to obtain topologies that yield the maximum consensus speed. Within the ADMM substep, we adopt the conjugate gradient method to efficiently solve large-scale linear equations to achieve better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting network topologies outperform the benchmark topologies in terms of consensus speed, and reduce the training time required for decentralized learning tasks on real-world datasets to achieve the target test accuracy, exhibiting speedups of more than $1.11\times$ and $1.21\times$ for homogeneous and heterogeneous bandwidth settings, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Canonical bidirectional typechecking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07511v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the checkable/synthesisable split in bidirectional typechecking coincides with existing dualities in polarised System L, also known as polarised $μ\tildeμ$-calculus. Specifically, positive terms and negative coterms are checkable, and negative terms and positive coterms are synthesisable. This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative. This yields a remarkable 3-way coincidence between the shifts of polarised System L, LNL calculi, and bidirectional calculi.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |

We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect to an abstract notion of adapters relating types.

DNNs are often partitioned and executed across heterogeneous processing units to optimize latency and energy. However, the reliability of these partitioned models under hardware faults and communication errors remains a critical yet underexplored topic, especially in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware, fault-resilient DNN partitioning framework targeting multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II, where accuracy degradation under fault conditions is introduced as a core metric alongside energy and latency. Our framework performs runtime fault injection during optimization and utilizes a feedback loop to prioritize fault-tolerant partitioning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark CNNs including AlexNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet18 on hardware accelerators, and demonstrate up to 27.7% improvement in fault tolerance with minimal increase in performance overhead. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating resilience into DNN partitioning, and thereby paving the way for robust AI inference in error-prone environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Communication-Efficient Serving for Video Diffusion Models with Latent Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07350v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) perform attention computation over the 3D spatio-temporal domain. Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services.</p></details> | 19 pages |

While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026</p></details> |

Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing. We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups. Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[PIP: Making Andersen's Points-to Analysis Sound and Practical for Incomplete C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07299v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

However, modern Industrial Internet of Things systems increasingly operate over distributed, resource-constrained edge-cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes a structured approach for decentralizing process mining by enabling event data to be mined directly within the IoT systems edge-cloud continuum. We introduce ContinuumConductor a layered decision framework that guides when to perform process mining tasks such as preprocessing, correlation, and discovery centrally or decentrally. Thus, enabling privacy, responsive and resource-efficient process mining. For each step in the process mining pipeline, we analyze the trade-offs of decentralization versus centralization across these layers and propose decision criteria. We demonstrate ContinuumConductor at a real-world use-case of process optimazition in inland ports.

In this work, ADLAH is introduced: an Adaptive Deep Learning Anomaly Detection Honeynet designed to maximize high-fidelity threat intelligence while minimizing cost through autonomous orchestration of infrastructure. The principal contribution is offered as an end-to-end architectural blueprint and vision for an AI-driven deception platform. Feasibility is evidenced by a functional prototype of the central decision mechanism, in which a reinforcement learning (RL) agent determines, in real time, when sessions should be escalated from low-interaction sensor nodes to dynamically provisioned, high-interaction honeypots. Because sufficient live data were unavailable, field-scale validation is not claimed; instead, design trade-offs and limitations are detailed, and a rigorous roadmap toward empirical evaluation at scale is provided. Beyond selective escalation and anomaly detection, the architecture pursues automated extraction, clustering, and versioning of bot attack chains, a core capability motivated by the empirical observation that exposed services are dominated by automated traffic. Together, these elements delineate a practical path toward cost-efficient capture of high-value adversary behavior, systematic bot versioning, and the production of actionable threat intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Most schedulers treat workloads as single monolithic tasks, ignoring that many jobs, like video encoding or offline inference, consist of smaller tasks with specific dependencies and resource needs; however, knowledge of this structure enables opportunities for greater carbon efficiency. We quantify the maximum benefit of a dependency-aware approach for batch workloads. We model the problem as a flexible job-shop scheduling variant and use an offline solver to compute upper bounds on carbon and energy savings. Results show up to $25\%$ lower carbon emissions on average without increasing the optimal makespan (total job completion time) compared to a makespan-only baseline. Although in heterogeneous server setup, these schedules may use more energy than energy-optimal ones. Our results also show that allowing twice the optimal makespan nearly doubles the carbon savings, underscoring the tension between carbon, energy, and makespan. We also highlight key factors such as job structure and server count influence the achievable carbon reductions.</p></details> |  |

At Meta, it's used across the company for various tasks such as deriving product insights, providing and improving user services, and enabling AI at scale for our ever-growing user base. Meta's current stream processing framework supports processing TerraBytes(TBs) of data in mere seconds. This is enabled by our efficient schedulers and multi-layered infrastructure, which allocate workloads across various compute resources, working together in hierarchies across various parts of the infrastructure. But with the ever growing complexity of applications, and user needs, areas of the infrastructure that previously required minimal load balancing, now must be made more robust and proactive to application load. In our work we explore how to build and design such a system that focuses on load balancing over key compute resources and properties of these applications. We also showcase how to integrate new schedulers into the hierarchy of the existing ones, allowing multiple schedulers to work together and perform load balancing, at their infrastructure level, effectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[H2EAL: Hybrid-Bonding Architecture with Hybrid Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16653v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bandwidth-Aware Network Topology Optimization for Decentralized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07536v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network topology is critical for efficient parameter synchronization in distributed learning over networks. However, most existing studies do not account for bandwidth limitations in network topology design. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware network topology optimization framework to maximize consensus speed under edge cardinality constraints. For heterogeneous bandwidth scenarios, we introduce a maximum bandwidth allocation strategy for the edges to ensure efficient communication among nodes. By reformulating the problem into an equivalent Mixed-Integer SDP problem, we leverage a computationally efficient ADMM-based method to obtain topologies that yield the maximum consensus speed. Within the ADMM substep, we adopt the conjugate gradient method to efficiently solve large-scale linear equations to achieve better scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that the resulting network topologies outperform the benchmark topologies in terms of consensus speed, and reduce the training time required for decentralized learning tasks on real-world datasets to achieve the target test accuracy, exhibiting speedups of more than $1.11\times$ and $1.21\times$ for homogeneous and heterogeneous bandwidth settings, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Canonical bidirectional typechecking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07511v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We demonstrate that the checkable/synthesisable split in bidirectional typechecking coincides with existing dualities in polarised System L, also known as polarised $μ\tildeμ$-calculus. Specifically, positive terms and negative coterms are checkable, and negative terms and positive coterms are synthesisable. This combines a standard formulation of bidirectional typechecking with Zeilberger's `cocontextual' variant. We extend this to ordinary `cartesian' System L using Mc Bride's co-de Bruijn formulation of scopes, and show that both can be combined in a linear-nonlinear style, where linear types are positive and cartesian types are negative. This yields a remarkable 3-way coincidence between the shifts of polarised System L, LNL calculi, and bidirectional calculi.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Bus-Mounted Edge Servers Feasible?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05543v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Placement of edge servers is the prerequisite of provisioning edge computing services for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable.</p></details> |  |

These casts all exhibit a common structural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type formers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect to an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for functorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts on general inductive type formers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version, with appendices, of a paper published at POPL '26</p></details> |
| **[AFarePart: Accuracy-aware Fault-resilient Partitioner for DNN Edge Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07449v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across distributed and resource-constrained platforms, such as System-on-Chip (SoC) accelerators and edge-cloud systems. DNNs are often partitioned and executed across heterogeneous processing units to optimize latency and energy. However, the reliability of these partitioned models under hardware faults and communication errors remains a critical yet underexplored topic, especially in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware, fault-resilient DNN partitioning framework targeting multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II, where accuracy degradation under fault conditions is introduced as a core metric alongside energy and latency. Our framework performs runtime fault injection during optimization and utilizes a feedback loop to prioritize fault-tolerant partitioning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark CNNs including AlexNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet18 on hardware accelerators, and demonstrate up to 27.7% improvement in fault tolerance with minimal increase in performance overhead. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating resilience into DNN partitioning, and thereby paving the way for robust AI inference in error-prone environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Communication-Efficient Serving for Video Diffusion Models with Latent Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07350v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) perform attention computation over the 3D spatio-temporal domain. Compared to large language models (LLMs) processing 1D sequences, their memory consumption scales cubically, necessitating parallel serving across multiple GPUs. Traditional parallelism strategies partition the computational graph, requiring frequent high-dimensional activation transfers that create severe communication bottlenecks. To tackle this issue, we exploit the local spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the diffusion denoising process and propose Latent Parallelism (LP), the first parallelism strategy tailored for VDM serving. \textcolor{black}{LP decomposes the global denoising problem into parallelizable sub-problems by dynamically rotating the partitioning dimensions (temporal, height, and width) within the compact latent space across diffusion timesteps, substantially reducing the communication overhead compared to prevailing parallelism strategies.} To ensure generation quality, we design a patch-aligned overlapping partition strategy that matches partition boundaries with visual patches and a position-aware latent reconstruction mechanism for smooth stitching. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that LP reduces communication overhead by up to 97\% over baseline methods while maintaining comparable generation quality. As a non-intrusive plug-in paradigm, LP can be seamlessly integrated with existing parallelism strategies, enabling efficient and scalable video generation services.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Venus: An Efficient Edge Memory-and-Retrieval System for VLM-based Online Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07344v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal comprehension capabilities and are being deployed in an increasing number of online video understanding applications. While recent efforts extensively explore advancing VLMs' reasoning power in these cases, deployment constraints are overlooked, leading to overwhelming system overhead in real-world deployments. To address that, we propose Venus, an on-device memory-and-retrieval system for efficient online video understanding. Venus proposes an edge-cloud disaggregated architecture that sinks memory construction and keyframe retrieval from cloud to edge, operating in two stages. In the ingestion stage, Venus continuously processes streaming edge videos via scene segmentation and clustering, where the selected keyframes are embedded with a multimodal embedding model to build a hierarchical memory for efficient storage and retrieval. In the querying stage, Venus indexes incoming queries from memory, and employs a threshold-based progressive sampling algorithm for keyframe selection that enhances diversity and adaptively balances system cost and reasoning accuracy. Our extensive evaluation shows that Venus achieves a 15x-131x speedup in total response latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time responses within seconds while maintaining comparable or even superior reasoning accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications 2026</p></details> |
| **[DCO: Dynamic Cache Orchestration for LLM Accelerators through Predictive Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07312v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing. We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups. Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[PIP: Making Andersen's Points-to Analysis Sound and Practical for Incomplete C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07299v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

However, modern Industrial Internet of Things systems increasingly operate over distributed, resource-constrained edge-cloud infrastructures. This paper proposes a structured approach for decentralizing process mining by enabling event data to be mined directly within the IoT systems edge-cloud continuum. We introduce ContinuumConductor a layered decision framework that guides when to perform process mining tasks such as preprocessing, correlation, and discovery centrally or decentrally. Thus, enabling privacy, responsive and resource-efficient process mining. For each step in the process mining pipeline, we analyze the trade-offs of decentralization versus centralization across these layers and propose decision criteria. We demonstrate ContinuumConductor at a real-world use-case of process optimazition in inland ports. Our contributions lay the foundation for computing-aware process mining in cyber-physical and IIoT systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COMINDS workshop ICPM2025</p></details> |
