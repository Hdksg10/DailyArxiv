| **[WANDER: An Explainable Decision-Support Framework for HPC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04049v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) systems expose many interdependent configuration knobs that impact runtime, resource usage, power, and variability. Existing predictive tools model these outcomes, but do not support structured exploration, explanation, or guided reconfiguration. We present WANDER, a decision-support framework that synthesizes alternate configurations using counterfactual analysis aligned with user goals and constraints. We introduce a composite trade-off score that ranks suggestions based on prediction uncertainty, consistency between feature-target relationships using causal models, and similarity between feature distributions against historical data. To our knowledge, WANDER is the first such system to unify prediction, exploration, and explanation for HPC tuning under a common query interface. Across multiple datasets WANDER generates interpretable and trustworthy, human-readable alternatives that guide users to achieve their performance objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAPID-LLM: Resilience-Aware Performance analysis of Infrastructure for Distributed LLM Training and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19606v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RAPID-LLM is a unified performance modeling framework for large language model (LLM) training and inference on GPU clusters. It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies. Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Parallel GPU-Enabled Algorithms for SpGEMM on Arbitrary Semirings with Hybrid Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06408v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse General Matrix Multiply (SpGEMM) is key for various High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications such as genomics and graph analytics. Using the semiring abstraction, many algorithms can be formulated as SpGEMM, allowing redefinition of addition, multiplication, and numeric types. Today large input matrices require distributed memory parallelism to avoid disk I/O, and modern HPC machines with GPUs can greatly accelerate linear algebra computation. In this paper, we implement a GPU-based distributed-memory SpGEMM routine on top of the CombBLAS library. Our implementation achieves a speedup of over 2x compared to the CPU-only CombBLAS implementation and up to 3x compared to PETSc for large input matrices. Furthermore, we note that communication between processes can be optimized by either direct host-to-host or device-to-device communication, depending on the message size. To exploit this, we introduce a hybrid communication scheme that dynamically switches data paths depending on the message size, thus improving runtimes in communication-bound scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faster Distributed Inference-Only Recommender Systems via Bounded Lag Synchronous Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19342v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems are enablers of personalized content delivery, and therefore revenue, for many large companies. In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulations between Strongly Sublinear MPC and Node-Capacitated Clique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19326v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how the strongly sublinear MPC model relates to the classic, graph-centric distributed models, focusing on the Node-Capacitated Clique (NCC), a bandwidth-parametrized generalization of the Congested Clique. In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$. Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pricing for On-Demand DNN Inference in the Edge-AI Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04521v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications at the network edge. A key research challenge in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference by offloading partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We develop a multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and theoretically analyze the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties. These include competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness in auction outcomes. Extensive simulations based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that AERIA significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization. This validates the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

| **[Small Language Models as Compiler Experts: Auto-Parallelization for Heterogeneous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19250v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional auto-parallelizing compilers, reliant on rigid heuristics, struggle with the complexity of modern heterogeneous systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of small (approximately 1B parameter) language-model-driven compiler auto-parallelization. We evaluate three models: gemma3, llama3.2, and qwen2.5, using six reasoning strategies across 11 real-world kernels drawn from scientific computing, graph algorithms, and machine learning. Our system is benchmarked against strong compiler baselines, including LLVM Polly, TVM, and Triton. Across 376 total evaluations, the proposed approach achieves an average speedup of 6.81x and a peak performance of 43.25x on convolution operations. We analyze scalability, verify correctness using multiple sanitizers, and confirm robustness across diverse compilers and hardware platforms. Our results demonstrate that small, efficient language models can serve as powerful reasoning engines for complex compiler optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 ML for Systems Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Ranking Software Variants with Minimal Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06716v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method, BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up to 99% without loss in ranking stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[L4: Low-Latency and Load-Balanced LLM Serving via Length-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19179v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Evidential Trust-Aware Model Personalization in Decentralized Federated Learning for Wearable IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19131v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19103v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Libra: Unleashing GPU Heterogeneity for High-Performance Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22714v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly equipped with Tensor Core Units (TCUs) and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The former excels at structured matrix computations, whereas the latter offers greater programming flexibility. However, how to combine these two resources to maximize sparse-operator performance remains unclear. In this work, we first identify the source of performance gains in hybrid computation and systematically analyze their complementary strengths. Motivated by this, we propose Libra, a holistic framework that efficiently leverages heterogeneous computing resources to accelerate both SpMM and SDDMM operators. Specifically, Libra introduces a 2D-aware (locality and utilization) workload distribution method to precisely identify the optimal task mapping, simultaneously leveraging the data reuse capabilities of TCUs and the flexibility of CUDA cores to minimize computational redundancy. Libra further incorporates hybrid load balancing, occupancy-aware task scheduling, and efficient kernel implementations to maximize execution efficiency. Extensive experiments on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs demonstrate that Libra surpasses all the 12 up-to-date baselines significantly, e.g., on average 1.77x speedup over FlashSparse, 1.73x over RoDe, and 2.9x over DGL for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for sparse operator acceleration by fully unleashing the power of heterogeneous GPU resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs. This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-Time Digital Twin for Adaptive Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18894v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) workloads are becoming increasingly diverse, exhibiting wide variability in job characteristics, yet cluster scheduling has long relied on static, heuristic-based policies. In this work we present SchedTwin, a real-time digital twin designed to adaptively guide scheduling decisions using predictive simulation. SchedTwin periodically ingests runtime events from the physical scheduler, performs rapid what-if evaluations of multiple policies using a high-fidelity discrete-event simulator, and dynamically selects the one satisfying the administrator configured optimization goal. We implement SchedTwin as an open-source software and integrate it with the production PBS scheduler. Preliminary results show that SchedTwin consistently outperforms widely used static scheduling policies, while maintaining low overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle). These results demonstrate that real-time digital twins offer a practical and effective path toward adaptive HPC scheduling.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Taking advantage of exascale computing capabilities is essential for these efforts. However, the unprecedented architectural complexity of exascale systems impacts legacy codes. The SPACE Centre of Excellence (CoE) aims to re-engineer key astrophysical codes to tackle new computational challenges by adopting innovative programming paradigms and software (SW) solutions. SPACE brings together scientists, code developers, HPC experts, hardware (HW) manufacturers, and SW developers. This collaboration enhances exascale A&C applications, promoting the use of exascale and post-exascale computing capabilities. Additionally, SPACE addresses high-performance data analysis for the massive data outputs from exascale simulations and modern observations, using machine learning (ML) and visualisation tools.

| **[DafnyMPI: A Dafny Library for Verifying Message-Passing Concurrent Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18842v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is widely used in parallel, high-performance programming, yet writing bug-free software that uses MPI remains difficult. We introduce DafnyMPI, a novel, scalable approach to formally verifying MPI software. DafnyMPI allows proving deadlock freedom, termination, and functional equivalence with simpler sequential implementations. In contrast to existing specialized frameworks, DafnyMPI avoids custom concurrency logics and instead relies on Dafny, a verification-ready programming language used for sequential programs, extending it with concurrent reasoning abilities. DafnyMPI is implemented as a library that enables safe MPI programming by requiring users to specify the communication topology upfront and to verify that calls to communication primitives such as MPI_ISEND and MPI_WAIT meet their preconditions. We formalize DafnyMPI using a core calculus and prove that the preconditions suffice to guarantee deadlock freedom. Functional equivalence is proved via rely-guarantee reasoning over message payloads and a system that guarantees safe use of read and write buffers. Termination and the absence of runtime errors are proved using standard Dafny techniques. To further demonstrate the applicability of DafnyMPI, we verify numerical solutions to three canonical partial differential equations. We believe DafnyMPI demonstrates how to make formal verification viable for a broader class of programs and provides proof engineers with additional tools for software verification of parallel and concurrent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (POPL)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its industrial and academic popularity, OOP is still missing a formal apparatus similar to \(λ\)-calculus, which functional programming is based on. A number of attempts were made to formalize OOP, but none of them managed to cover all the features available in modern OO programming languages, such as C++ or Java. We have made yet another attempt and created \(\varphi\)-calculus. This paper does not demonstrate the practical use or effect of \\(varphi\) but merely explains it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, preliminary version presented at Asilomar Conference, 2025</p></details> |

It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies. Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Parallel GPU-Enabled Algorithms for SpGEMM on Arbitrary Semirings with Hybrid Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06408v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse General Matrix Multiply (SpGEMM) is key for various High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications such as genomics and graph analytics. Using the semiring abstraction, many algorithms can be formulated as SpGEMM, allowing redefinition of addition, multiplication, and numeric types. Today large input matrices require distributed memory parallelism to avoid disk I/O, and modern HPC machines with GPUs can greatly accelerate linear algebra computation. In this paper, we implement a GPU-based distributed-memory SpGEMM routine on top of the CombBLAS library. Our implementation achieves a speedup of over 2x compared to the CPU-only CombBLAS implementation and up to 3x compared to PETSc for large input matrices. Furthermore, we note that communication between processes can be optimized by either direct host-to-host or device-to-device communication, depending on the message size. To exploit this, we introduce a hybrid communication scheme that dynamically switches data paths depending on the message size, thus improving runtimes in communication-bound scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.</p></details> |  |

In MPC, $M$ machines with per-machine memory $S$ hold a partition of the input graph, in NCC, each node knows its full neighborhood but can send/receive only a bounded number of $C$ words per round. We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$. Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pricing for On-Demand DNN Inference in the Edge-AI Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04521v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gives rise to Edge-AI, which enables the deployment of real-time AI applications at the network edge. A key research challenge in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference by offloading partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We develop a multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and theoretically analyze the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties. These include competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness in auction outcomes. Extensive simulations based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that AERIA significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization. This validates the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of small (approximately 1B parameter) language-model-driven compiler auto-parallelization. We evaluate three models: gemma3, llama3.2, and qwen2.5, using six reasoning strategies across 11 real-world kernels drawn from scientific computing, graph algorithms, and machine learning. Our system is benchmarked against strong compiler baselines, including LLVM Polly, TVM, and Triton. Across 376 total evaluations, the proposed approach achieves an average speedup of 6.81x and a peak performance of 43.25x on convolution operations. We analyze scalability, verify correctness using multiple sanitizers, and confirm robustness across diverse compilers and hardware platforms. Our results demonstrate that small, efficient language models can serve as powerful reasoning engines for complex compiler optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 ML for Systems Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Ranking Software Variants with Minimal Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06716v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method, BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up to 99% without loss in ranking stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[L4: Low-Latency and Load-Balanced LLM Serving via Length-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19179v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Evidential Trust-Aware Model Personalization in Decentralized Federated Learning for Wearable IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19131v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19103v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Libra: Unleashing GPU Heterogeneity for High-Performance Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22714v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly equipped with Tensor Core Units (TCUs) and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The former excels at structured matrix computations, whereas the latter offers greater programming flexibility. However, how to combine these two resources to maximize sparse-operator performance remains unclear. In this work, we first identify the source of performance gains in hybrid computation and systematically analyze their complementary strengths. Motivated by this, we propose Libra, a holistic framework that efficiently leverages heterogeneous computing resources to accelerate both SpMM and SDDMM operators. Specifically, Libra introduces a 2D-aware (locality and utilization) workload distribution method to precisely identify the optimal task mapping, simultaneously leveraging the data reuse capabilities of TCUs and the flexibility of CUDA cores to minimize computational redundancy. Libra further incorporates hybrid load balancing, occupancy-aware task scheduling, and efficient kernel implementations to maximize execution efficiency. Extensive experiments on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs demonstrate that Libra surpasses all the 12 up-to-date baselines significantly, e.g., on average 1.77x speedup over FlashSparse, 1.73x over RoDe, and 2.9x over DGL for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for sparse operator acceleration by fully unleashing the power of heterogeneous GPU resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs. This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.</p></details> |  |

In this work we present SchedTwin, a real-time digital twin designed to adaptively guide scheduling decisions using predictive simulation. SchedTwin periodically ingests runtime events from the physical scheduler, performs rapid what-if evaluations of multiple policies using a high-fidelity discrete-event simulator, and dynamically selects the one satisfying the administrator configured optimization goal. We implement SchedTwin as an open-source software and integrate it with the production PBS scheduler. Preliminary results show that SchedTwin consistently outperforms widely used static scheduling policies, while maintaining low overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle). These results demonstrate that real-time digital twins offer a practical and effective path toward adaptive HPC scheduling.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce DafnyMPI, a novel, scalable approach to formally verifying MPI software. DafnyMPI allows proving deadlock freedom, termination, and functional equivalence with simpler sequential implementations. In contrast to existing specialized frameworks, DafnyMPI avoids custom concurrency logics and instead relies on Dafny, a verification-ready programming language used for sequential programs, extending it with concurrent reasoning abilities. DafnyMPI is implemented as a library that enables safe MPI programming by requiring users to specify the communication topology upfront and to verify that calls to communication primitives such as MPI_ISEND and MPI_WAIT meet their preconditions. We formalize DafnyMPI using a core calculus and prove that the preconditions suffice to guarantee deadlock freedom. Functional equivalence is proved via rely-guarantee reasoning over message payloads and a system that guarantees safe use of read and write buffers. Termination and the absence of runtime errors are proved using standard Dafny techniques. To further demonstrate the applicability of DafnyMPI, we verify numerical solutions to three canonical partial differential equations. We believe DafnyMPI demonstrates how to make formal verification viable for a broader class of programs and provides proof engineers with additional tools for software verification of parallel and concurrent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (POPL)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

A number of attempts were made to formalize OOP, but none of them managed to cover all the features available in modern OO programming languages, such as C++ or Java.

| **[Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, preliminary version presented at Asilomar Conference, 2025</p></details> |

Existing predictive tools model these outcomes, but do not support structured exploration, explanation, or guided reconfiguration. We present WANDER, a decision-support framework that synthesizes alternate configurations using counterfactual analysis aligned with user goals and constraints. We introduce a composite trade-off score that ranks suggestions based on prediction uncertainty, consistency between feature-target relationships using causal models, and similarity between feature distributions against historical data. To our knowledge, WANDER is the first such system to unify prediction, exploration, and explanation for HPC tuning under a common query interface. Across multiple datasets WANDER generates interpretable and trustworthy, human-readable alternatives that guide users to achieve their performance objectives.</p></details> |  |

It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies. Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Using the semiring abstraction, many algorithms can be formulated as SpGEMM, allowing redefinition of addition, multiplication, and numeric types. Today large input matrices require distributed memory parallelism to avoid disk I/O, and modern HPC machines with GPUs can greatly accelerate linear algebra computation. In this paper, we implement a GPU-based distributed-memory SpGEMM routine on top of the CombBLAS library. Our implementation achieves a speedup of over 2x compared to the CPU-only CombBLAS implementation and up to 3x compared to PETSc for large input matrices. Furthermore, we note that communication between processes can be optimized by either direct host-to-host or device-to-device communication, depending on the message size. To exploit this, we introduce a hybrid communication scheme that dynamically switches data paths depending on the message size, thus improving runtimes in communication-bound scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In the last decade, deep learning recommender models (DLRMs) are the de-facto standard in this field. The main bottleneck in DLRM inference is the lookup of sparse features across huge embedding tables, which are usually partitioned across the aggregate RAM of many nodes. In state-of-the-art recommender systems, the distributed lookup is implemented via irregular all-to-all (alltoallv) communication, and often presents the main bottleneck. Today, most related work sees this operation as a given; in addition, every collective is synchronous in nature. In this work, we propose a novel bounded lag synchronous (BLS) version of the alltoallv operation. The bound can be a parameter allowing slower processes to lag behind entire iterations before the fastest processes block. In special applications such as inference-only DLRM, the accuracy of the application is fully preserved. We implement BLS alltoallv in a new PyTorch Distributed backend and evaluate it with a BLS version of the reference DLRM code. We show that for well balanced, homogeneous-access DLRM runs our BLS technique does not offer notable advantages. But for unbalanced runs, e.g. runs with strongly irregular embedding table accesses or with delays across different processes, our BLS technique improves both the latency and throughput of inference-only DLRM. In the best-case scenario, the proposed reduced synchronisation can mask the delays across processes altogether.</p></details> |  |

We are particularly interested in the strongly sublinear regime where $S=C=n^δ$ for some constant $0 < δ<1$. Our goal is determine when round-preserving simulations between these models are possible and when they are not, when total memory and total bandwidth $SM=nC$ in both models are matched, for different problem families and graph classes. On the positive side, we provide techniques that allow us to replicate the specific behavior regarding input representation, number of machines and local memory from one model to the other to obtain simulations with only constant overhead. On the negative side, we prove simulation impossibility results, which show that the limitations of our simulations are necessary.</p></details> |  |

A key research challenge in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference by offloading partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We develop a multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and theoretically analyze the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of small (approximately 1B parameter) language-model-driven compiler auto-parallelization. We evaluate three models: gemma3, llama3.2, and qwen2.5, using six reasoning strategies across 11 real-world kernels drawn from scientific computing, graph algorithms, and machine learning. Our system is benchmarked against strong compiler baselines, including LLVM Polly, TVM, and Triton. Across 376 total evaluations, the proposed approach achieves an average speedup of 6.81x and a peak performance of 43.25x on convolution operations. We analyze scalability, verify correctness using multiple sanitizers, and confirm robustness across diverse compilers and hardware platforms. Our results demonstrate that small, efficient language models can serve as powerful reasoning engines for complex compiler optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 ML for Systems Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Ranking Software Variants with Minimal Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06716v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method, BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up to 99% without loss in ranking stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[L4: Low-Latency and Load-Balanced LLM Serving via Length-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19179v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently harnessing GPU compute is critical to improving user experience and reducing operational costs in large language model (LLM) services. However, current inference engine schedulers overlook the attention backend's sensitivity to request-length heterogeneity within a batch. As state-of-the-art models now support context windows exceeding 128K tokens, this once-tolerable inefficiency has escalated into a primary system bottleneck, causing severe performance degradation through GPU underutilization and increased latency. We present L4, a runtime system that dynamically reschedules requests across multiple instances serving the same LLM to mitigate per-instance length heterogeneity. L4 partitions these instances into length-specialized groups, each handling requests within a designated length range, naturally forming a pipeline as requests flow through them. L4 devises a dynamic programming algorithm to efficiently find the stage partition with the best QoE, employs runtime range refinement together with decentralized load (re)balance both across and within groups, achieving a balanced and efficient multi-instance service. Our evaluation shows that, under the same configuration, L4 reduces end-to-end latency by up to 67% and tail latency by up to 69%, while improving overall system throughput by up to 2.89 times compared to the state-of-the-art multi-instance scheduling systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Evidential Trust-Aware Model Personalization in Decentralized Federated Learning for Wearable IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19131v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables collaborative model training across edge devices without centralized coordination, offering resilience against single points of failure. However, statistical heterogeneity arising from non-identically distributed local data creates a fundamental challenge: nodes must learn personalized models adapted to their local distributions while selectively collaborating with compatible peers. Existing approaches either enforce a single global model that fits no one well, or rely on heuristic peer selection mechanisms that cannot distinguish between peers with genuinely incompatible data distributions and those with valuable complementary knowledge. We present Murmura, a framework that leverages evidential deep learning to enable trust-aware model personalization in DFL. Our key insight is that epistemic uncertainty from Dirichlet-based evidential models directly indicates peer compatibility: high epistemic uncertainty when a peer's model evaluates local data reveals distributional mismatch, enabling nodes to exclude incompatible influence while maintaining personalized models through selective collaboration. Murmura introduces a trust-aware aggregation mechanism that computes peer compatibility scores through cross-evaluation on local validation samples and personalizes model aggregation based on evidential trust with adaptive thresholds. Evaluation on three wearable IoT datasets (UCI HAR, PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA) demonstrates that Murmura reduces performance degradation from IID to non-IID conditions compared to baseline (0.9% vs. 19.3%), achieves 7.4$\times$ faster convergence, and maintains stable accuracy across hyperparameter choices. These results establish evidential uncertainty as a principled foundation for compatibility-aware personalization in decentralized heterogeneous environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timely Parameter Updating in Over-the-Air Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19103v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating over-the-air computations (OAC) into the model training process of federated learning (FL) is an effective approach to alleviating the communication bottleneck in FL systems. Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Libra: Unleashing GPU Heterogeneity for High-Performance Sparse Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22714v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly equipped with Tensor Core Units (TCUs) and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The former excels at structured matrix computations, whereas the latter offers greater programming flexibility. However, how to combine these two resources to maximize sparse-operator performance remains unclear. In this work, we first identify the source of performance gains in hybrid computation and systematically analyze their complementary strengths. Motivated by this, we propose Libra, a holistic framework that efficiently leverages heterogeneous computing resources to accelerate both SpMM and SDDMM operators. Specifically, Libra introduces a 2D-aware (locality and utilization) workload distribution method to precisely identify the optimal task mapping, simultaneously leveraging the data reuse capabilities of TCUs and the flexibility of CUDA cores to minimize computational redundancy. Libra further incorporates hybrid load balancing, occupancy-aware task scheduling, and efficient kernel implementations to maximize execution efficiency. Extensive experiments on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs demonstrate that Libra surpasses all the 12 up-to-date baselines significantly, e.g., on average 1.77x speedup over FlashSparse, 1.73x over RoDe, and 2.9x over DGL for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for sparse operator acceleration by fully unleashing the power of heterogeneous GPU resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[JITServe: SLO-aware LLM Serving with Imprecise Request Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20068v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications ranging from interactive chatbots to multi-agent systems has introduced a wide spectrum of service-level objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These include latency-sensitive requests emphasizing per-token latency in streaming chat, deadline-sensitive requests requiring rapid full responses to trigger external tools, and compound requests with evolving dependencies across multiple LLM calls. Despite-or perhaps, because of-this workload diversity and unpredictable request information (e.g., response lengths and dependencies), existing request schedulers have focused on aggregate performance, unable to ensure application-level SLO needs. This paper presents JITServe, the first SLO-aware LLM serving system designed to maximize service goodput (e.g., the number of tokens meeting request SLOs) across diverse workloads. JITServe novelly schedules requests using imprecise request information and gradually relaxes this conservatism by refining request information estimates as generation progresses. It applies a grouped margin goodput maximization algorithm to allocate just enough serving bandwidth to satisfy each request's SLO just-in-time (JIT), maximizing residual capacity for others, while deciding the composition of requests in a batch to maximize efficiency and goodput with provable guarantees. Our evaluation across diverse realistic workloads, including chat, deep research, and agentic pipelines, shows that JITServe improves service goodput by 1.4x-6.3x, alternatively achieving 28.5%-83.2% resource savings, compared to state-of-the-art designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[QoS-Aware Load Balancing in the Computing Continuum via Multi-Player Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18915v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As computation shifts from the cloud to the edge to reduce processing latency and network traffic, the resulting Computing Continuum (CC) creates a dynamic environment where it is challenging to meet strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and avoid service instance overload. Existing methods often prioritize global metrics, overlooking per-client QoS, which is crucial for latency-sensitive and reliability-critical applications. We propose QEdgeProxy, a decentralized QoS-aware load balancer that acts as a proxy between IoT devices and service instances in CC. We formulate the load balancing problem as a Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit (MP-MAB) with heterogeneous rewards, where each load balancer autonomously selects service instances that maximize the probability of meeting its clients' QoS targets by using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate QoS success probabilities. It also incorporates an adaptive exploration mechanism to recover rapidly from performance shifts and non-stationary conditions. We present a Kubernetes-native QEdgeProxy implementation and evaluate it on an emulated CC testbed deployed on a K3s cluster with realistic network conditions and a latency-sensitive edge-AI workload. Results show that QEdgeProxy significantly outperforms proximity-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in per-client QoS satisfaction, while adapting effectively to load surges and instance availability changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Real-Time Digital Twin for Adaptive Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18894v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) workloads are becoming increasingly diverse, exhibiting wide variability in job characteristics, yet cluster scheduling has long relied on static, heuristic-based policies. In this work we present SchedTwin, a real-time digital twin designed to adaptively guide scheduling decisions using predictive simulation. SchedTwin periodically ingests runtime events from the physical scheduler, performs rapid what-if evaluations of multiple policies using a high-fidelity discrete-event simulator, and dynamically selects the one satisfying the administrator configured optimization goal. We implement SchedTwin as an open-source software and integrate it with the production PBS scheduler. Preliminary results show that SchedTwin consistently outperforms widely used static scheduling policies, while maintaining low overhead (a few seconds per scheduling cycle). These results demonstrate that real-time digital twins offer a practical and effective path toward adaptive HPC scheduling.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

| **[DafnyMPI: A Dafny Library for Verifying Message-Passing Concurrent Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18842v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is widely used in parallel, high-performance programming, yet writing bug-free software that uses MPI remains difficult. We introduce DafnyMPI, a novel, scalable approach to formally verifying MPI software. DafnyMPI allows proving deadlock freedom, termination, and functional equivalence with simpler sequential implementations. In contrast to existing specialized frameworks, DafnyMPI avoids custom concurrency logics and instead relies on Dafny, a verification-ready programming language used for sequential programs, extending it with concurrent reasoning abilities. DafnyMPI is implemented as a library that enables safe MPI programming by requiring users to specify the communication topology upfront and to verify that calls to communication primitives such as MPI_ISEND and MPI_WAIT meet their preconditions. We formalize DafnyMPI using a core calculus and prove that the preconditions suffice to guarantee deadlock freedom. Functional equivalence is proved via rely-guarantee reasoning over message payloads and a system that guarantees safe use of read and write buffers. Termination and the absence of runtime errors are proved using standard Dafny techniques. To further demonstrate the applicability of DafnyMPI, we verify numerical solutions to three canonical partial differential equations. We believe DafnyMPI demonstrates how to make formal verification viable for a broader class of programs and provides proof engineers with additional tools for software verification of parallel and concurrent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (POPL)</p></details> |
| **[Remoe: Towards Efficient and Low-Cost MoE Inference in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18674v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, despite its industrial and academic popularity, OOP is still missing a formal apparatus similar to \(λ\)-calculus, which functional programming is based on. A number of attempts were made to formalize OOP, but none of them managed to cover all the features available in modern OO programming languages, such as C++ or Java. We have made yet another attempt and created \(\varphi\)-calculus. This paper does not demonstrate the practical use or effect of \\(varphi\) but merely explains it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, preliminary version presented at Asilomar Conference, 2025</p></details> |
